DEDICATION
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
Bob Southey! You&rsquo;re a poet, poet laureate,<br/>
    And representative of all the race.<br/>
Although &rsquo;tis true that you turned out a Tory at<br/>
    Last, yours has lately been a common case.<br/>
And now my epic renegade, what are ye at<br/>
    With all the lakers, in and out of place?<br/>
A nest of tuneful persons, to my eye<br/>
Like four and twenty blackbirds in a pye,<br/>
<br/>
Which pye being opened they began to sing&rsquo;<br/>
    (This old song and new simile holds good),<br/>
&lsquo;A dainty dish to set before the King&rsquo;<br/>
    Or Regent, who admires such kind of food.<br/>
And Coleridge too has lately taken wing,<br/>
    But like a hawk encumbered with his hood,<br/>
Explaining metaphysics to the nation.<br/>
I wish he would explain his explanation.<br/>
<br/>
You, Bob, are rather insolent, you know,<br/>
    At being disappointed in your wish<br/>
To supersede all warblers here below,<br/>
    And be the only blackbird in the dish.<br/>
And then you overstrain yourself, or so,<br/>
    And tumble downward like the flying fish<br/>
Gasping on deck, because you soar too high,<br/>
Bob, And fall for lack of moisture quite a dry Bob.<br/>
<br/>
And Wordsworth in a rather long Excursion<br/>
    (I think the quarto holds five hundred pages)<br/>
Has given a sample from the vasty version<br/>
    Of his new system to perplex the sages.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis poetry, at least by his assertion,<br/>
    And may appear so when the Dog Star rages,<br/>
And he who understands it would be able<br/>
To add a story to the tower of Babel.<br/>
<br/>
You gentlemen, by dint of long seclusion<br/>
    From better company, have kept your own<br/>
At Keswick, and through still continued fusion<br/>
    Of one another&rsquo;s minds at last have grown<br/>
To deem, as a most logical conclusion,<br/>
    That poesy has wreaths for you alone.<br/>
There is a narrowness in such a notion,<br/>
Which makes me wish you&rsquo;d change your lakes for ocean.<br/>
<br/>
I would not imitate the petty thought,<br/>
    Nor coin my self-love to so base a vice,<br/>
For all the glory your conversion brought,<br/>
    Since gold alone should not have been its price.<br/>
You have your salary; was&rsquo;t for that you wrought?<br/>
    And Wordsworth has his place in the Excise.<br/>
You&rsquo;re shabby fellows&mdash;true&mdash;but poets still<br/>
And duly seated on the immortal hill.<br/>
<br/>
Your bays may hide the baldness of your brows,<br/>
    Perhaps some virtuous blushes; let them go.<br/>
To you I envy neither fruit nor boughs,<br/>
    And for the fame you would engross below,<br/>
The field is universal and allows<br/>
    Scope to all such as feel the inherent glow.<br/>
Scott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and Crabbe will try<br/>
&rsquo;Gainst you the question with posterity.<br/>
<br/>
For me, who, wandering with pedestrian Muses,<br/>
    Contend not with you on the winged&rsquo; steed,<br/>
I wish your fate may yield ye, when she chooses,<br/>
    The fame you envy and the skill you need.<br/>
And recollect a poet nothing loses<br/>
    In giving to his brethren their full meed<br/>
Of merit, and complaint of present days<br/>
Is not the certain path to future praise.<br/>
<br/>
He that reserves his laurels for posterity<br/>
    (Who does not often claim the bright reversion)<br/>
Has generally no great crop to spare it, he<br/>
    Being only injured by his own assertion.<br/>
And although here and there some glorious rarity<br/>
    Arise like Titan from the sea&rsquo;s immersion,<br/>
The major part of such appellants go<br/>
To&mdash;God knows where&mdash;for no one else can know.<br/>
<br/>
If fallen in evil days on evil tongues,<br/>
    Milton appealed to the avenger, Time,<br/>
If Time, the avenger, execrates his wrongs<br/>
    And makes the word Miltonic mean sublime,<br/>
He deigned not to belie his soul in songs,<br/>
    Nor turn his very talent to a crime.<br/>
He did not loathe the sire to laud the son,<br/>
But closed the tyrant-hater he begun.<br/>
<br/>
Think&rsquo;st thou, could he, the blind old man, arise<br/>
    Like Samuel from the grave to freeze once more<br/>
The blood of monarchs with his prophecies,<br/>
     Or be alive again&mdash;again all hoar<br/>
With time and trials, and those helpless eyes<br/>
    And heartless daughters&mdash;worn and pale and poor,<br/>
Would he adore a sultan? He obey<br/>
The intellectual eunuch Castlereagh?<br/>
<br/>
Cold-blooded, smooth-faced, placid miscreant!<br/>
    Dabbling its sleek young hands in Erin&rsquo;s gore,<br/>
And thus for wider carnage taught to pant,<br/>
    Transferred to gorge upon a sister shore,<br/>
The vulgarest tool that tyranny could want,<br/>
    With just enough of talent and no more,<br/>
To lengthen fetters by another fixed<br/>
And offer poison long already mixed.<br/>
<br/>
An orator of such set trash of phrase,<br/>
    Ineffably, legitimately vile,<br/>
That even its grossest flatterers dare not praise,<br/>
    Nor foes&mdash;all nations&mdash;condescend to smile.<br/>
Not even a sprightly blunder&rsquo;s spark can blaze<br/>
    From that Ixion grindstone&rsquo;s ceaseless toil,<br/>
That turns and turns to give the world a notion<br/>
Of endless torments and perpetual motion.<br/>
<br/>
A bungler even in its disgusting trade,<br/>
    And botching, patching, leaving still behind<br/>
Something of which its masters are afraid,<br/>
    States to be curbed and thoughts to be confined,<br/>
Conspiracy or congress to be made,<br/>
    Cobbling at manacles for all mankind,<br/>
A tinkering slave-maker, who mends old chains,<br/>
With God and man&rsquo;s abhorrence for its gains.<br/>
<br/>
If we may judge of matter by the mind,<br/>
Emasculated to the marrow, it<br/>
Hath but two objects, how to serve and bind,<br/>
Deeming the chain it wears even men may fit,<br/>
Eutropius of its many masters, blind<br/>
To worth as freedom, wisdom as to wit,<br/>
Fearless, because no feeling dwells in ice;<br/>
Its very courage stagnates to a vice.<br/>
<br/>
Where shall I turn me not to view its bonds,<br/>
    For I will never feel them. Italy,<br/>
Thy late reviving Roman soul desponds<br/>
    Beneath the lie this state-thing breathed o&rsquo;er thee.<br/>
Thy clanking chain and Erin&rsquo;s yet green wounds<br/>
    Have voices, tongues to cry aloud for me.<br/>
Europe has slaves, allies, kings, armies still,<br/>
And Southey lives to sing them very ill.<br/>
<br/>
Meantime, Sir Laureate, I proceed to dedicate<br/>
    In honest simple verse this song to you.<br/>
And if in flattering strains I do not predicate,<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis that I still retain my buff and blue;<br/>
My politics as yet are all to educate.<br/>
    Apostasy&rsquo;s so fashionable too,<br/>
To keep one creed&rsquo;s a task grown quite<br/>
Herculean Is it not so, my Tory, ultra-Julian?<br/>

CANTO THE FIRST
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
I want a hero: an uncommon want,<br/>
    When every year and month sends forth a new one,<br/>
Till, after cloying the gazettes with cant,<br/>
    The age discovers he is not the true one;<br/>
Of such as these I should not care to vaunt,<br/>
    I&rsquo;ll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan&mdash;<br/>
We all have seen him, in the pantomime,<br/>
Sent to the devil somewhat ere his time.<br/>
<br/>
Vernon, the butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,<br/>
    Prince Ferdinand, Granby, Burgoyne, Keppel, Howe,<br/>
Evil and good, have had their tithe of talk,<br/>
    And fill&rsquo;d their sign posts then, like Wellesley now;<br/>
Each in their turn like Banquo&rsquo;s monarchs stalk,<br/>
    Followers of fame, &lsquo;nine farrow&rsquo; of that sow:<br/>
France, too, had Buonaparte and Dumourier<br/>
Recorded in the Moniteur and Courier.<br/>
<br/>
Barnave, Brissot, Condorcet, Mirabeau,<br/>
    Petion, Clootz, Danton, Marat, La Fayette,<br/>
Were French, and famous people, as we know:<br/>
    And there were others, scarce forgotten yet,<br/>
Joubert, Hoche, Marceau, Lannes, Desaix, Moreau,<br/>
    With many of the military set,<br/>
Exceedingly remarkable at times,<br/>
But not at all adapted to my rhymes.<br/>
<br/>
Nelson was once Britannia&rsquo;s god of war,<br/>
    And still should be so, but the tide is turn&rsquo;d;<br/>
There&rsquo;s no more to be said of Trafalgar,<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis with our hero quietly inurn&rsquo;d;<br/>
Because the army &rsquo;s grown more popular,<br/>
    At which the naval people are concern&rsquo;d;<br/>
Besides, the prince is all for the land-service,<br/>
Forgetting Duncan, Nelson, Howe, and Jervis.<br/>
<br/>
Brave men were living before Agamemnon<br/>
    And since, exceeding valorous and sage,<br/>
A good deal like him too, though quite the same none;<br/>
    But then they shone not on the poet&rsquo;s page,<br/>
And so have been forgotten:&mdash;I condemn none,<br/>
    But can&rsquo;t find any in the present age<br/>
Fit for my poem (that is, for my new one);<br/>
So, as I said, I&rsquo;ll take my friend Don Juan.<br/>
<br/>
Most epic poets plunge &lsquo;in medias res&rsquo;<br/>
    (Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),<br/>
And then your hero tells, whene&rsquo;er you please,<br/>
    What went before&mdash;by way of episode,<br/>
While seated after dinner at his ease,<br/>
    Beside his mistress in some soft abode,<br/>
Palace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,<br/>
Which serves the happy couple for a tavern.<br/>
<br/>
That is the usual method, but not mine&mdash;<br/>
    My way is to begin with the beginning;<br/>
The regularity of my design<br/>
    Forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning,<br/>
And therefore I shall open with a line<br/>
    (Although it cost me half an hour in spinning)<br/>
Narrating somewhat of Don Juan&rsquo;s father,<br/>
And also of his mother, if you&rsquo;d rather.<br/>
<br/>
In Seville was he born, a pleasant city,<br/>
    Famous for oranges and women&mdash;he<br/>
Who has not seen it will be much to pity,<br/>
    So says the proverb&mdash;and I quite agree;<br/>
Of all the Spanish towns is none more pretty,<br/>
    Cadiz perhaps&mdash;but that you soon may see;<br/>
Don Juan&rsquo;s parents lived beside the river,<br/>
A noble stream, and call&rsquo;d the Guadalquivir.<br/>
<br/>
His father&rsquo;s name was Jose&mdash;Don, of course,&mdash;<br/>
    A true Hidalgo, free from every stain<br/>
Of Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source<br/>
    Through the most Gothic gentlemen of Spain;<br/>
A better cavalier ne&rsquo;er mounted horse,<br/>
    Or, being mounted, e&rsquo;er got down again,<br/>
Than Jose, who begot our hero, who<br/>
Begot&mdash;but that &rsquo;s to come&mdash;Well, to renew:<br/>
<br/>
His mother was a learned lady, famed<br/>
    For every branch of every science known<br/>
In every Christian language ever named,<br/>
    With virtues equall&rsquo;d by her wit alone,<br/>
She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,<br/>
    And even the good with inward envy groan,<br/>
Finding themselves so very much exceeded<br/>
In their own way by all the things that she did.<br/>
<br/>
Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart<br/>
    All Calderon and greater part of Lope,<br/>
So that if any actor miss&rsquo;d his part<br/>
    She could have served him for the prompter&rsquo;s copy;<br/>
For her Feinagle&rsquo;s were an useless art,<br/>
    And he himself obliged to shut up shop&mdash;he<br/>
Could never make a memory so fine as<br/>
That which adorn&rsquo;d the brain of Donna Inez.<br/>
<br/>
Her favourite science was the mathematical,<br/>
    Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,<br/>
Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,<br/>
    Her serious sayings darken&rsquo;d to sublimity;<br/>
In short, in all things she was fairly what I call<br/>
    A prodigy&mdash;her morning dress was dimity,<br/>
Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,<br/>
And other stuffs, with which I won&rsquo;t stay puzzling.<br/>
<br/>
She knew the Latin&mdash;that is, &lsquo;the Lord&rsquo;s prayer,&rsquo;<br/>
    And Greek&mdash;the alphabet&mdash;I&rsquo;m nearly sure;<br/>
She read some French romances here and there,<br/>
    Although her mode of speaking was not pure;<br/>
For native Spanish she had no great care,<br/>
    At least her conversation was obscure;<br/>
Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,<br/>
As if she deem&rsquo;d that mystery would ennoble &rsquo;em.<br/>
<br/>
She liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,<br/>
    And said there was analogy between &rsquo;em;<br/>
She proved it somehow out of sacred song,<br/>
    But I must leave the proofs to those who&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em;<br/>
But this I heard her say, and can&rsquo;t be wrong<br/>
    And all may think which way their judgments lean &rsquo;em,<br/>
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis strange&mdash;the Hebrew noun which means &ldquo;I am,&rdquo;<br/>
The English always use to govern d--n.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Some women use their tongues&mdash;she look&rsquo;d a lecture,<br/>
    Each eye a sermon, and her brow a homily,<br/>
An all-in-all sufficient self-director,<br/>
    Like the lamented late Sir Samuel Romilly,<br/>
The Law&rsquo;s expounder, and the State&rsquo;s corrector,<br/>
    Whose suicide was almost an anomaly&mdash;<br/>
One sad example more, that &lsquo;All is vanity&rsquo;<br/>
(The jury brought their verdict in &lsquo;Insanity&rsquo;).<br/>
<br/>
In short, she was a walking calculation,<br/>
    Miss Edgeworth&rsquo;s novels stepping from their covers,<br/>
Or Mrs. Trimmer&rsquo;s books on education,<br/>
    Or &lsquo;Coelebs&rsquo; Wife&rsquo; set out in quest of lovers,<br/>
Morality&rsquo;s prim personification,<br/>
    In which not Envy&rsquo;s self a flaw discovers;<br/>
To others&rsquo; share let &lsquo;female errors fall,&rsquo;<br/>
For she had not even one&mdash;the worst of all.<br/>
<br/>
O! she was perfect past all parallel&mdash;<br/>
    Of any modern female saint&rsquo;s comparison;<br/>
So far above the cunning powers of hell,<br/>
    Her guardian angel had given up his garrison;<br/>
Even her minutest motions went as well<br/>
    As those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:<br/>
In virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,<br/>
Save thine &lsquo;incomparable oil,&rsquo; Macassar!<br/>
<br/>
Perfect she was, but as perfection is<br/>
    Insipid in this naughty world of ours,<br/>
Where our first parents never learn&rsquo;d to kiss<br/>
    Till they were exiled from their earlier bowers,<br/>
Where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss<br/>
    (I wonder how they got through the twelve hours),<br/>
Don Jose, like a lineal son of Eve,<br/>
Went plucking various fruit without her leave.<br/>
<br/>
He was a mortal of the careless kind,<br/>
    With no great love for learning, or the learn&rsquo;d,<br/>
Who chose to go where&rsquo;er he had a mind,<br/>
    And never dream&rsquo;d his lady was concern&rsquo;d;<br/>
The world, as usual, wickedly inclined<br/>
    To see a kingdom or a house o&rsquo;erturn&rsquo;d,<br/>
Whisper&rsquo;d he had a mistress, some said two&mdash;<br/>
But for domestic quarrels one will do.<br/>
<br/>
Now Donna Inez had, with all her merit,<br/>
    A great opinion of her own good qualities;<br/>
Neglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,<br/>
    And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;<br/>
But then she had a devil of a spirit,<br/>
    And sometimes mix&rsquo;d up fancies with realities,<br/>
And let few opportunities escape<br/>
Of getting her liege lord into a scrape.<br/>
<br/>
This was an easy matter with a man<br/>
    Oft in the wrong, and never on his guard;<br/>
And even the wisest, do the best they can,<br/>
    Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,<br/>
That you might &lsquo;brain them with their lady&rsquo;s fan;&rsquo;<br/>
    And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,<br/>
And fans turn into falchions in fair hands,<br/>
And why and wherefore no one understands.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis pity learned virgins ever wed<br/>
    With persons of no sort of education,<br/>
Or gentlemen, who, though well born and bred,<br/>
    Grow tired of scientific conversation:<br/>
I don&rsquo;t choose to say much upon this head,<br/>
    I&rsquo;m a plain man, and in a single station,<br/>
But&mdash;Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,<br/>
Inform us truly, have they not hen-peck&rsquo;d you all?<br/>
<br/>
Don Jose and his lady quarrell&rsquo;d&mdash;why,<br/>
    Not any of the many could divine,<br/>
Though several thousand people chose to try,<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas surely no concern of theirs nor mine;<br/>
I loathe that low vice&mdash;curiosity;<br/>
    But if there&rsquo;s anything in which I shine,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis in arranging all my friends&rsquo; affairs,<br/>
Not having of my own domestic cares.<br/>
<br/>
And so I interfered, and with the best<br/>
    Intentions, but their treatment was not kind;<br/>
I think the foolish people were possess&rsquo;d,<br/>
    For neither of them could I ever find,<br/>
Although their porter afterwards confess&rsquo;d&mdash;<br/>
    But that &rsquo;s no matter, and the worst &rsquo;s behind,<br/>
For little Juan o&rsquo;er me threw, down stairs,<br/>
A pail of housemaid&rsquo;s water unawares.<br/>
<br/>
A little curly-headed, good-for-nothing,<br/>
    And mischief-making monkey from his birth;<br/>
His parents ne&rsquo;er agreed except in doting<br/>
    Upon the most unquiet imp on earth;<br/>
Instead of quarrelling, had they been but both in<br/>
    Their senses, they&rsquo;d have sent young master forth<br/>
To school, or had him soundly whipp&rsquo;d at home,<br/>
To teach him manners for the time to come.<br/>
<br/>
Don Jose and the Donna Inez led<br/>
    For some time an unhappy sort of life,<br/>
Wishing each other, not divorced, but dead;<br/>
    They lived respectably as man and wife,<br/>
Their conduct was exceedingly well-bred,<br/>
    And gave no outward signs of inward strife,<br/>
Until at length the smother&rsquo;d fire broke out,<br/>
And put the business past all kind of doubt.<br/>
<br/>
For Inez call&rsquo;d some druggists and physicians,<br/>
    And tried to prove her loving lord was mad;<br/>
But as he had some lucid intermissions,<br/>
    She next decided he was only bad;<br/>
Yet when they ask&rsquo;d her for her depositions,<br/>
    No sort of explanation could be had,<br/>
Save that her duty both to man and God<br/>
Required this conduct&mdash;which seem&rsquo;d very odd.<br/>
<br/>
She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,<br/>
    And open&rsquo;d certain trunks of books and letters,<br/>
All which might, if occasion served, be quoted;<br/>
    And then she had all Seville for abettors,<br/>
Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);<br/>
    The hearers of her case became repeaters,<br/>
Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,<br/>
Some for amusement, others for old grudges.<br/>
<br/>
And then this best and weakest woman bore<br/>
    With such serenity her husband&rsquo;s woes,<br/>
Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,<br/>
    Who saw their spouses kill&rsquo;d, and nobly chose<br/>
Never to say a word about them more&mdash;<br/>
    Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,<br/>
And saw his agonies with such sublimity,<br/>
That all the world exclaim&rsquo;d, &lsquo;What magnanimity!&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,<br/>
    Is philosophic in our former friends;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis also pleasant to be deem&rsquo;d magnanimous,<br/>
    The more so in obtaining our own ends;<br/>
And what the lawyers call a &lsquo;malus animus&rsquo;<br/>
    Conduct like this by no means comprehends;<br/>
Revenge in person &rsquo;s certainly no virtue,<br/>
But then &rsquo;tis not my fault, if others hurt you.<br/>
<br/>
And if your quarrels should rip up old stories,<br/>
    And help them with a lie or two additional,<br/>
I&rsquo;m not to blame, as you well know&mdash;no more is<br/>
    Any one else&mdash;they were become traditional;<br/>
Besides, their resurrection aids our glories<br/>
    By contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:<br/>
And science profits by this resurrection&mdash;<br/>
Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection.<br/>
<br/>
Their friends had tried at reconciliation,<br/>
    Then their relations, who made matters worse.<br/>
(&rsquo;Twere hard to tell upon a like occasion<br/>
    To whom it may be best to have recourse&mdash;<br/>
I can&rsquo;t say much for friend or yet relation):<br/>
    The lawyers did their utmost for divorce,<br/>
But scarce a fee was paid on either side<br/>
Before, unluckily, Don Jose died.<br/>
<br/>
He died: and most unluckily, because,<br/>
    According to all hints I could collect<br/>
From counsel learned in those kinds of laws<br/>
    (Although their talk &rsquo;s obscure and circumspect),<br/>
His death contrived to spoil a charming cause;<br/>
    A thousand pities also with respect<br/>
To public feeling, which on this occasion<br/>
Was manifested in a great sensation.<br/>
<br/>
But, ah! he died; and buried with him lay<br/>
    The public feeling and the lawyers&rsquo; fees:<br/>
His house was sold, his servants sent away,<br/>
    A Jew took one of his two mistresses,<br/>
A priest the other&mdash;at least so they say:<br/>
    I ask&rsquo;d the doctors after his disease&mdash;<br/>
He died of the slow fever call&rsquo;d the tertian,<br/>
And left his widow to her own aversion.<br/>
<br/>
Yet Jose was an honourable man,<br/>
    That I must say who knew him very well;<br/>
Therefore his frailties I&rsquo;ll no further scan<br/>
    Indeed there were not many more to tell;<br/>
And if his passions now and then outran<br/>
    Discretion, and were not so peaceable<br/>
As Numa&rsquo;s (who was also named Pompilius),<br/>
He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.<br/>
<br/>
Whate&rsquo;er might be his worthlessness or worth,<br/>
    Poor fellow! he had many things to wound him.<br/>
Let &rsquo;s own&mdash;since it can do no good on earth&mdash;<br/>
    It was a trying moment that which found him<br/>
Standing alone beside his desolate hearth,<br/>
    Where all his household gods lay shiver&rsquo;d round him:<br/>
No choice was left his feelings or his pride,<br/>
Save death or Doctors&rsquo; Commons&mdash;so he died.<br/>
<br/>
Dying intestate, Juan was sole heir<br/>
    To a chancery suit, and messuages, and lands,<br/>
Which, with a long minority and care,<br/>
    Promised to turn out well in proper hands:<br/>
Inez became sole guardian, which was fair,<br/>
    And answer&rsquo;d but to nature&rsquo;s just demands;<br/>
An only son left with an only mother<br/>
Is brought up much more wisely than another.<br/>
<br/>
Sagest of women, even of widows, she<br/>
    Resolved that Juan should be quite a paragon,<br/>
And worthy of the noblest pedigree<br/>
    (His sire was of Castile, his dam from Aragon):<br/>
Then for accomplishments of chivalry,<br/>
    In case our lord the king should go to war again,<br/>
He learn&rsquo;d the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,<br/>
And how to scale a fortress&mdash;or a nunnery.<br/>
<br/>
But that which Donna Inez most desired,<br/>
    And saw into herself each day before all<br/>
The learned tutors whom for him she hired,<br/>
    Was, that his breeding should be strictly moral;<br/>
Much into all his studies she inquired,<br/>
    And so they were submitted first to her, all,<br/>
Arts, sciences, no branch was made a mystery<br/>
To Juan&rsquo;s eyes, excepting natural history.<br/>
<br/>
The languages, especially the dead,<br/>
    The sciences, and most of all the abstruse,<br/>
The arts, at least all such as could be said<br/>
    To be the most remote from common use,<br/>
In all these he was much and deeply read;<br/>
    But not a page of any thing that &rsquo;s loose,<br/>
Or hints continuation of the species,<br/>
Was ever suffer&rsquo;d, lest he should grow vicious.<br/>
<br/>
His classic studies made a little puzzle,<br/>
    Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,<br/>
Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,<br/>
    But never put on pantaloons or bodices;<br/>
His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,<br/>
    And for their AEneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,<br/>
Were forced to make an odd sort! of apology,<br/>
For Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology.<br/>
<br/>
Ovid &rsquo;s a rake, as half his verses show him,<br/>
    Anacreon&rsquo;s morals are a still worse sample,<br/>
Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,<br/>
    I don&rsquo;t think Sappho&rsquo;s Ode a good example,<br/>
Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn<br/>
    Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:<br/>
But Virgil&rsquo;s songs are pure, except that horrid one<br/>
Beginning with &lsquo;Formosum Pastor Corydon.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Lucretius&rsquo; irreligion is too strong,<br/>
    For early stomachs, to prove wholesome food;<br/>
I can&rsquo;t help thinking Juvenal was wrong,<br/>
    Although no doubt his real intent was good,<br/>
For speaking out so plainly in his song,<br/>
    So much indeed as to be downright rude;<br/>
And then what proper person can be partial<br/>
To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?<br/>
<br/>
Juan was taught from out the best edition,<br/>
    Expurgated by learned men, who place<br/>
Judiciously, from out the schoolboy&rsquo;s vision,<br/>
    The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface<br/>
Too much their modest bard by this omission,<br/>
    And pitying sore his mutilated case,<br/>
They only add them all in an appendix,<br/>
Which saves, in fact, the trouble of an index;<br/>
<br/>
For there we have them all &lsquo;at one fell swoop,&rsquo;<br/>
    Instead of being scatter&rsquo;d through the Pages;<br/>
They stand forth marshall&rsquo;d in a handsome troop,<br/>
    To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages,<br/>
Till some less rigid editor shall stoop<br/>
    To call them back into their separate cages,<br/>
Instead of standing staring all together,<br/>
Like garden gods&mdash;and not so decent either.<br/>
<br/>
The Missal too (it was the family Missal)<br/>
    Was ornamented in a sort of way<br/>
Which ancient mass-books often are, and this all<br/>
    Kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,<br/>
Who saw those figures on the margin kiss all,<br/>
    Could turn their optics to the text and pray,<br/>
Is more than I know&mdash;But Don Juan&rsquo;s mother<br/>
Kept this herself, and gave her son another.<br/>
<br/>
Sermons he read, and lectures he endured,<br/>
    And homilies, and lives of all the saints;<br/>
To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,<br/>
    He did not take such studies for restraints;<br/>
But how faith is acquired, and then ensured,<br/>
    So well not one of the aforesaid paints<br/>
As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,<br/>
Which make the reader envy his transgressions.<br/>
<br/>
This, too, was a seal&rsquo;d book to little Juan&mdash;<br/>
    I can&rsquo;t but say that his mamma was right,<br/>
If such an education was the true one.<br/>
    She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;<br/>
Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,<br/>
    You might be sure she was a perfect fright;<br/>
She did this during even her husband&rsquo;s life&mdash;<br/>
I recommend as much to every wife.<br/>
<br/>
Young Juan wax&rsquo;d in goodliness and grace;<br/>
    At six a charming child, and at eleven<br/>
With all the promise of as fine a face<br/>
    As e&rsquo;er to man&rsquo;s maturer growth was given:<br/>
He studied steadily, and grew apace,<br/>
    And seem&rsquo;d, at least, in the right road to heaven,<br/>
For half his days were pass&rsquo;d at church, the other<br/>
Between his tutors, confessor, and mother.<br/>
<br/>
At six, I said, he was a charming child,<br/>
    At twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy;<br/>
Although in infancy a little wild,<br/>
    They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy<br/>
His natural spirit not in vain they toil&rsquo;d,<br/>
    At least it seem&rsquo;d so; and his mother&rsquo;s joy<br/>
Was to declare how sage, and still, and steady,<br/>
Her young philosopher was grown already.<br/>
<br/>
I had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,<br/>
    But what I say is neither here nor there:<br/>
I knew his father well, and have some skill<br/>
    In character&mdash;but it would not be fair<br/>
From sire to son to augur good or ill:<br/>
    He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair&mdash;<br/>
But scandal &rsquo;s my aversion&mdash;I protest<br/>
Against all evil speaking, even in jest.<br/>
<br/>
For my part I say nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;but<br/>
    This I will say&mdash;my reasons are my own&mdash;<br/>
That if I had an only son to put<br/>
    To school (as God be praised that I have none),<br/>
&rsquo;Tis not with Donna Inez I would shut<br/>
    Him up to learn his catechism alone,<br/>
No&mdash;no&mdash;I&rsquo;d send him out betimes to college,<br/>
For there it was I pick&rsquo;d up my own knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
For there one learns&mdash;&rsquo;tis not for me to boast,<br/>
    Though I acquired&mdash;but I pass over that,<br/>
As well as all the Greek I since have lost:<br/>
    I say that there&rsquo;s the place&mdash;but &lsquo;Verbum sat.&rsquo;<br/>
I think I pick&rsquo;d up too, as well as most,<br/>
    Knowledge of matters&mdash;but no matter what&mdash;<br/>
I never married&mdash;but, I think, I know<br/>
That sons should not be educated so.<br/>
<br/>
Young Juan now was sixteen years of age,<br/>
    Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seem&rsquo;d<br/>
Active, though not so sprightly, as a page;<br/>
    And everybody but his mother deem&rsquo;d<br/>
Him almost man; but she flew in a rage<br/>
    And bit her lips (for else she might have scream&rsquo;d)<br/>
If any said so, for to be precocious<br/>
Was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.<br/>
<br/>
Amongst her numerous acquaintance, all<br/>
    Selected for discretion and devotion,<br/>
There was the Donna Julia, whom to call<br/>
    Pretty were but to give a feeble notion<br/>
Of many charms in her as natural<br/>
    As sweetness to the flower, or salt to ocean,<br/>
Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid<br/>
(But this last simile is trite and stupid).<br/>
<br/>
The darkness of her Oriental eye<br/>
    Accorded with her Moorish origin<br/>
(Her blood was not all Spanish, by the by;<br/>
    In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin);<br/>
When proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,<br/>
    Boabdil wept, of Donna Julia&rsquo;s kin<br/>
Some went to Africa, some stay&rsquo;d in Spain,<br/>
Her great-great-grandmamma chose to remain.<br/>
<br/>
She married (I forget the pedigree)<br/>
    With an Hidalgo, who transmitted down<br/>
His blood less noble than such blood should be;<br/>
    At such alliances his sires would frown,<br/>
In that point so precise in each degree<br/>
    That they bred in and in, as might be shown,<br/>
Marrying their cousins&mdash;nay, their aunts, and nieces,<br/>
Which always spoils the breed, if it increases.<br/>
<br/>
This heathenish cross restored the breed again,<br/>
    Ruin&rsquo;d its blood, but much improved its flesh;<br/>
For from a root the ugliest in Old Spain<br/>
    Sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;<br/>
The sons no more were short, the daughters plain:<br/>
    But there&rsquo;s a rumour which I fain would hush,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis said that Donna Julia&rsquo;s grandmamma<br/>
Produced her Don more heirs at love than law.<br/>
<br/>
However this might be, the race went on<br/>
    Improving still through every generation,<br/>
Until it centred in an only son,<br/>
    Who left an only daughter; my narration<br/>
May have suggested that this single one<br/>
    Could be but Julia (whom on this occasion<br/>
I shall have much to speak about), and she<br/>
Was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.<br/>
<br/>
Her eye (I&rsquo;m very fond of handsome eyes)<br/>
    Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire<br/>
Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise<br/>
    Flash&rsquo;d an expression more of pride than ire,<br/>
And love than either; and there would arise<br/>
    A something in them which was not desire,<br/>
But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul<br/>
Which struggled through and chasten&rsquo;d down the whole.<br/>
<br/>
Her glossy hair was cluster&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er a brow<br/>
    Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;<br/>
Her eyebrow&rsquo;s shape was like th&rsquo; aerial bow,<br/>
    Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,<br/>
Mounting at times to a transparent glow,<br/>
    As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,<br/>
Possess&rsquo;d an air and grace by no means common:<br/>
Her stature tall&mdash;I hate a dumpy woman.<br/>
<br/>
Wedded she was some years, and to a man<br/>
    Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;<br/>
And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE<br/>
    &rsquo;Twere better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,<br/>
Especially in countries near the sun:<br/>
    And now I think on &rsquo;t, &lsquo;mi vien in mente,&rsquo;<br/>
Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue<br/>
Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,<br/>
    And all the fault of that indecent sun,<br/>
Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay,<br/>
    But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,<br/>
That howsoever people fast and pray,<br/>
    The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:<br/>
What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,<br/>
Is much more common where the climate &rsquo;s sultry.<br/>
<br/>
Happy the nations of the moral North!<br/>
    Where all is virtue, and the winter season<br/>
Sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth<br/>
    (&rsquo;Twas snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);<br/>
Where juries cast up what a wife is worth,<br/>
    By laying whate&rsquo;er sum in mulct they please on<br/>
The lover, who must pay a handsome price,<br/>
Because it is a marketable vice.<br/>
<br/>
Alfonso was the name of Julia&rsquo;s lord,<br/>
    A man well looking for his years, and who<br/>
Was neither much beloved nor yet abhorr&rsquo;d:<br/>
    They lived together, as most people do,<br/>
Suffering each other&rsquo;s foibles by accord,<br/>
    And not exactly either one or two;<br/>
Yet he was jealous, though he did not show it,<br/>
For jealousy dislikes the world to know it.<br/>
<br/>
Julia was&mdash;yet I never could see why&mdash;<br/>
    With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;<br/>
Between their tastes there was small sympathy,<br/>
    For not a line had Julia ever penn&rsquo;d:<br/>
Some people whisper but no doubt they lie,<br/>
    For malice still imputes some private end,<br/>
That Inez had, ere Don Alfonso&rsquo;s marriage,<br/>
Forgot with him her very prudent carriage;<br/>
<br/>
And that still keeping up the old connection,<br/>
    Which time had lately render&rsquo;d much more chaste,<br/>
She took his lady also in affection,<br/>
    And certainly this course was much the best:<br/>
She flatter&rsquo;d Julia with her sage protection,<br/>
    And complimented Don Alfonso&rsquo;s taste;<br/>
And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,<br/>
At least she left it a more slender handle.<br/>
<br/>
I can&rsquo;t tell whether Julia saw the affair<br/>
    With other people&rsquo;s eyes, or if her own<br/>
Discoveries made, but none could be aware<br/>
    Of this, at least no symptom e&rsquo;er was shown;<br/>
Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,<br/>
    Indifferent from the first or callous grown:<br/>
I&rsquo;m really puzzled what to think or say,<br/>
She kept her counsel in so close a way.<br/>
<br/>
Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,<br/>
    Caress&rsquo;d him often&mdash;such a thing might be<br/>
Quite innocently done, and harmless styled,<br/>
    When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;<br/>
But I am not so sure I should have smiled<br/>
    When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;<br/>
These few short years make wondrous alterations,<br/>
Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.<br/>
<br/>
Whate&rsquo;er the cause might be, they had become<br/>
    Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,<br/>
Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,<br/>
    And much embarrassment in either eye;<br/>
There surely will be little doubt with some<br/>
    That Donna Julia knew the reason why,<br/>
But as for Juan, he had no more notion<br/>
Than he who never saw the sea of ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Yet Julia&rsquo;s very coldness still was kind,<br/>
    And tremulously gentle her small hand<br/>
Withdrew itself from his, but left behind<br/>
    A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland<br/>
And slight, so very slight, that to the mind<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas but a doubt; but ne&rsquo;er magician&rsquo;s wand<br/>
Wrought change with all Armida&rsquo;s fairy art<br/>
Like what this light touch left on Juan&rsquo;s heart.<br/>
<br/>
And if she met him, though she smiled no more,<br/>
    She look&rsquo;d a sadness sweeter than her smile,<br/>
As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store<br/>
    She must not own, but cherish&rsquo;d more the while<br/>
For that compression in its burning core;<br/>
    Even innocence itself has many a wile,<br/>
And will not dare to trust itself with truth,<br/>
And love is taught hypocrisy from youth.<br/>
<br/>
But passion most dissembles, yet betrays<br/>
    Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky<br/>
Foretells the heaviest tempest, it displays<br/>
    Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,<br/>
And in whatever aspect it arrays<br/>
    Itself, &rsquo;tis still the same hypocrisy;<br/>
Coldness or anger, even disdain or hate,<br/>
Are masks it often wears, and still too late.<br/>
<br/>
Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,<br/>
    And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,<br/>
And burning blushes, though for no transgression,<br/>
    Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;<br/>
All these are little preludes to possession,<br/>
    Of which young passion cannot be bereft,<br/>
And merely tend to show how greatly love is<br/>
Embarrass&rsquo;d at first starting with a novice.<br/>
<br/>
Poor Julia&rsquo;s heart was in an awkward state;<br/>
    She felt it going, and resolved to make<br/>
The noblest efforts for herself and mate,<br/>
    For honour&rsquo;s, pride&rsquo;s, religion&rsquo;s, virtue&rsquo;s sake;<br/>
Her resolutions were most truly great,<br/>
    And almost might have made a Tarquin quake:<br/>
She pray&rsquo;d the Virgin Mary for her grace,<br/>
As being the best judge of a lady&rsquo;s case.<br/>
<br/>
She vow&rsquo;d she never would see Juan more,<br/>
    And next day paid a visit to his mother,<br/>
And look&rsquo;d extremely at the opening door,<br/>
    Which, by the Virgin&rsquo;s grace, let in another;<br/>
Grateful she was, and yet a little sore&mdash;<br/>
    Again it opens, it can be no other,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis surely Juan now&mdash;No! I&rsquo;m afraid<br/>
That night the Virgin was no further pray&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
She now determined that a virtuous woman<br/>
    Should rather face and overcome temptation,<br/>
That flight was base and dastardly, and no man<br/>
    Should ever give her heart the least sensation;<br/>
That is to say, a thought beyond the common<br/>
    Preference, that we must feel upon occasion<br/>
For people who are pleasanter than others,<br/>
But then they only seem so many brothers.<br/>
<br/>
And even if by chance&mdash;and who can tell?<br/>
    The devil &rsquo;s so very sly&mdash;she should discover<br/>
That all within was not so very well,<br/>
    And, if still free, that such or such a lover<br/>
Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell<br/>
    Such thoughts, and be the better when they&rsquo;re over;<br/>
And if the man should ask, &rsquo;tis but denial:<br/>
I recommend young ladies to make trial.<br/>
<br/>
And then there are such things as love divine,<br/>
    Bright and immaculate, unmix&rsquo;d and pure,<br/>
Such as the angels think so very fine,<br/>
    And matrons who would be no less secure,<br/>
Platonic, perfect, &lsquo;just such love as mine;&rsquo;<br/>
    Thus Julia said&mdash;and thought so, to be sure;<br/>
And so I&rsquo;d have her think, were I the man<br/>
On whom her reveries celestial ran.<br/>
<br/>
Such love is innocent, and may exist<br/>
    Between young persons without any danger.<br/>
A hand may first, and then a lip be kist;<br/>
    For my part, to such doings I&rsquo;m a stranger,<br/>
But hear these freedoms form the utmost list<br/>
    Of all o&rsquo;er which such love may be a ranger:<br/>
If people go beyond, &rsquo;tis quite a crime,<br/>
But not my fault&mdash;I tell them all in time.<br/>
<br/>
Love, then, but love within its proper limits,<br/>
    Was Julia&rsquo;s innocent determination<br/>
In young Don Juan&rsquo;s favour, and to him its<br/>
    Exertion might be useful on occasion;<br/>
And, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its<br/>
    Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion<br/>
He might be taught, by love and her together&mdash;<br/>
I really don&rsquo;t know what, nor Julia either.<br/>
<br/>
Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced<br/>
    In mail of proof&mdash;her purity of soul&mdash;<br/>
She, for the future of her strength convinced.<br/>
    And that her honour was a rock, or mole,<br/>
Exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed<br/>
    With any kind of troublesome control;<br/>
But whether Julia to the task was equal<br/>
Is that which must be mention&rsquo;d in the sequel.<br/>
<br/>
Her plan she deem&rsquo;d both innocent and feasible,<br/>
    And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen<br/>
Not scandal&rsquo;s fangs could fix on much that &rsquo;s seizable,<br/>
    Or if they did so, satisfied to mean<br/>
Nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable&mdash;<br/>
    A quiet conscience makes one so serene!<br/>
Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded<br/>
That all the Apostles would have done as they did.<br/>
<br/>
And if in the mean time her husband died,<br/>
    But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross<br/>
Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sigh&rsquo;d)<br/>
    Never could she survive that common loss;<br/>
But just suppose that moment should betide,<br/>
    I only say suppose it&mdash;inter nos.<br/>
(This should be entre nous, for Julia thought<br/>
In French, but then the rhyme would go for naught.)<br/>
<br/>
I only say suppose this supposition:<br/>
    Juan being then grown up to man&rsquo;s estate<br/>
Would fully suit a widow of condition,<br/>
    Even seven years hence it would not be too late;<br/>
And in the interim (to pursue this vision)<br/>
    The mischief, after all, could not be great,<br/>
For he would learn the rudiments of love,<br/>
I mean the seraph way of those above.<br/>
<br/>
So much for Julia. Now we&rsquo;ll turn to Juan.<br/>
    Poor little fellow! he had no idea<br/>
Of his own case, and never hit the true one;<br/>
    In feelings quick as Ovid&rsquo;s Miss Medea,<br/>
He puzzled over what he found a new one,<br/>
    But not as yet imagined it could be<br/>
Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,<br/>
Which, with a little patience, might grow charming.<br/>
<br/>
Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,<br/>
    His home deserted for the lonely wood,<br/>
Tormented with a wound he could not know,<br/>
    His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:<br/>
I&rsquo;m fond myself of solitude or so,<br/>
    But then, I beg it may be understood,<br/>
By solitude I mean a sultan&rsquo;s, not<br/>
A hermit&rsquo;s, with a haram for a grot.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,<br/>
    Where transport and security entwine,<br/>
Here is the empire of thy perfect bliss,<br/>
    And here thou art a god indeed divine.&rsquo;<br/>
The bard I quote from does not sing amiss,<br/>
    With the exception of the second line,<br/>
For that same twining &lsquo;transport and security&rsquo;<br/>
Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.<br/>
<br/>
The poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals<br/>
    To the good sense and senses of mankind,<br/>
The very thing which every body feels,<br/>
    As all have found on trial, or may find,<br/>
That no one likes to be disturb&rsquo;d at meals<br/>
    Or love.&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say more about &lsquo;entwined&rsquo;<br/>
Or &lsquo;transport,&rsquo; as we knew all that before,<br/>
But beg &lsquo;Security&rsquo; will bolt the door.<br/>
<br/>
Young Juan wander&rsquo;d by the glassy brooks,<br/>
    Thinking unutterable things; he threw<br/>
Himself at length within the leafy nooks<br/>
    Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;<br/>
There poets find materials for their books,<br/>
    And every now and then we read them through,<br/>
So that their plan and prosody are eligible,<br/>
Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.<br/>
<br/>
He, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued<br/>
    His self-communion with his own high soul,<br/>
Until his mighty heart, in its great mood,<br/>
    Had mitigated part, though not the whole<br/>
Of its disease; he did the best he could<br/>
    With things not very subject to control,<br/>
And turn&rsquo;d, without perceiving his condition,<br/>
Like Coleridge, into a metaphysician.<br/>
<br/>
He thought about himself, and the whole earth<br/>
    Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,<br/>
And how the deuce they ever could have birth;<br/>
    And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,<br/>
How many miles the moon might have in girth,<br/>
    Of air-balloons, and of the many bars<br/>
To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;&mdash;<br/>
And then he thought of Donna Julia&rsquo;s eyes.<br/>
<br/>
In thoughts like these true wisdom may discern<br/>
    Longings sublime, and aspirations high,<br/>
Which some are born with, but the most part learn<br/>
    To plague themselves withal, they know not why:<br/>
&rsquo;Twas strange that one so young should thus concern<br/>
    His brain about the action of the sky;<br/>
If you think &rsquo;twas philosophy that this did,<br/>
I can&rsquo;t help thinking puberty assisted.<br/>
<br/>
He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,<br/>
    And heard a voice in all the winds; and then<br/>
He thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,<br/>
    And how the goddesses came down to men:<br/>
He miss&rsquo;d the pathway, he forgot the hours,<br/>
    And when he look&rsquo;d upon his watch again,<br/>
He found how much old Time had been a winner&mdash;<br/>
He also found that he had lost his dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes he turn&rsquo;d to gaze upon his book,<br/>
    Boscan, or Garcilasso;&mdash;by the wind<br/>
Even as the page is rustled while we look,<br/>
    So by the poesy of his own mind<br/>
Over the mystic leaf his soul was shook,<br/>
    As if &rsquo;twere one whereon magicians bind<br/>
Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,<br/>
According to some good old woman&rsquo;s tale.<br/>
<br/>
Thus would he while his lonely hours away<br/>
    Dissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted;<br/>
Nor glowing reverie, nor poet&rsquo;s lay,<br/>
    Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,<br/>
A bosom whereon he his head might lay,<br/>
    And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,<br/>
With&mdash;several other things, which I forget,<br/>
Or which, at least, I need not mention yet.<br/>
<br/>
Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,<br/>
    Could not escape the gentle Julia&rsquo;s eyes;<br/>
She saw that Juan was not at his ease;<br/>
    But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,<br/>
Is, that the Donna Inez did not tease<br/>
    Her only son with question or surmise:<br/>
Whether it was she did not see, or would not,<br/>
Or, like all very clever people, could not.<br/>
<br/>
This may seem strange, but yet &rsquo;tis very common;<br/>
    For instance&mdash;gentlemen, whose ladies take<br/>
Leave to o&rsquo;erstep the written rights of woman,<br/>
    And break the&mdash;Which commandment is &rsquo;t they break?<br/>
(I have forgot the number, and think no man<br/>
    Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake.)<br/>
I say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,<br/>
They make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.<br/>
<br/>
A real husband always is suspicious,<br/>
    But still no less suspects in the wrong place,<br/>
Jealous of some one who had no such wishes,<br/>
    Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace,<br/>
By harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious;<br/>
    The last indeed &rsquo;s infallibly the case:<br/>
And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,<br/>
He wonders at their vice, and not his folly.<br/>
<br/>
Thus parents also are at times short-sighted;<br/>
    Though watchful as the lynx, they ne&rsquo;er discover,<br/>
The while the wicked world beholds delighted,<br/>
    Young Hopeful&rsquo;s mistress, or Miss Fanny&rsquo;s lover,<br/>
Till some confounded escapade has blighted<br/>
    The plan of twenty years, and all is over;<br/>
And then the mother cries, the father swears,<br/>
And wonders why the devil he got heirs.<br/>
<br/>
But Inez was so anxious, and so clear<br/>
    Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,<br/>
She had some other motive much more near<br/>
    For leaving Juan to this new temptation;<br/>
But what that motive was, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t say here;<br/>
    Perhaps to finish Juan&rsquo;s education,<br/>
Perhaps to open Don Alfonso&rsquo;s eyes,<br/>
In case he thought his wife too great a prize.<br/>
<br/>
It was upon a day, a summer&rsquo;s day.&mdash;<br/>
    Summer&rsquo;s indeed a very dangerous season,<br/>
And so is spring about the end of May;<br/>
    The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;<br/>
But whatsoe&rsquo;er the cause is, one may say,<br/>
    And stand convicted of more truth than treason,<br/>
That there are months which nature grows more merry in,&mdash;<br/>
March has its hares, and May must have its heroine.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Twas on a summer&rsquo;s day&mdash;the sixth of June:&mdash;<br/>
    I like to be particular in dates,<br/>
Not only of the age, and year, but moon;<br/>
    They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates<br/>
Change horses, making history change its tune,<br/>
    Then spur away o&rsquo;er empires and o&rsquo;er states,<br/>
Leaving at last not much besides chronology,<br/>
Excepting the post-obits of theology.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Twas on the sixth of June, about the hour<br/>
    Of half-past six&mdash;perhaps still nearer seven&mdash;<br/>
When Julia sate within as pretty a bower<br/>
    As e&rsquo;er held houri in that heathenish heaven<br/>
Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,<br/>
    To whom the lyre and laurels have been given,<br/>
With all the trophies of triumphant song&mdash;<br/>
He won them well, and may he wear them long!<br/>
<br/>
She sate, but not alone; I know not well<br/>
    How this same interview had taken place,<br/>
And even if I knew, I should not tell&mdash;<br/>
    People should hold their tongues in any case;<br/>
No matter how or why the thing befell,<br/>
    But there were she and Juan, face to face&mdash;<br/>
When two such faces are so, &rsquo;twould be wise,<br/>
But very difficult, to shut their eyes.<br/>
<br/>
How beautiful she look&rsquo;d! her conscious heart<br/>
    Glow&rsquo;d in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong.<br/>
O Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,<br/>
    Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong,<br/>
How self-deceitful is the sagest part<br/>
    Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along&mdash;<br/>
The precipice she stood on was immense,<br/>
So was her creed in her own innocence.<br/>
<br/>
She thought of her own strength, and Juan&rsquo;s youth,<br/>
    And of the folly of all prudish fears,<br/>
Victorious virtue, and domestic truth,<br/>
    And then of Don Alfonso&rsquo;s fifty years:<br/>
I wish these last had not occurr&rsquo;d, in sooth,<br/>
    Because that number rarely much endears,<br/>
And through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,<br/>
Sounds ill in love, whate&rsquo;er it may in money.<br/>
<br/>
When people say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve told you fifty times,&rsquo;<br/>
    They mean to scold, and very often do;<br/>
When poets say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve written fifty rhymes,&rsquo;<br/>
    They make you dread that they&rsquo;ll recite them too;<br/>
In gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes;<br/>
    At fifty love for love is rare, &rsquo;tis true,<br/>
But then, no doubt, it equally as true is,<br/>
A good deal may be bought for fifty Louis.<br/>
<br/>
Julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love,<br/>
    For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,<br/>
By all the vows below to powers above,<br/>
    She never would disgrace the ring she wore,<br/>
Nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;<br/>
    And while she ponder&rsquo;d this, besides much more,<br/>
One hand on Juan&rsquo;s carelessly was thrown,<br/>
Quite by mistake&mdash;she thought it was her own;<br/>
<br/>
Unconsciously she lean&rsquo;d upon the other,<br/>
    Which play&rsquo;d within the tangles of her hair:<br/>
And to contend with thoughts she could not smother<br/>
    She seem&rsquo;d by the distraction of her air.<br/>
&rsquo;Twas surely very wrong in Juan&rsquo;s mother<br/>
    To leave together this imprudent pair,<br/>
She who for many years had watch&rsquo;d her son so&mdash;<br/>
I&rsquo;m very certain mine would not have done so.<br/>
<br/>
The hand which still held Juan&rsquo;s, by degrees<br/>
    Gently, but palpably confirm&rsquo;d its grasp,<br/>
As if it said, &lsquo;Detain me, if you please;&rsquo;<br/>
    Yet there&rsquo;s no doubt she only meant to clasp<br/>
His fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze:<br/>
    She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,<br/>
Had she imagined such a thing could rouse<br/>
A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot know what Juan thought of this,<br/>
    But what he did, is much what you would do;<br/>
His young lip thank&rsquo;d it with a grateful kiss,<br/>
    And then, abash&rsquo;d at its own joy, withdrew<br/>
In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,&mdash;<br/>
    Love is so very timid when &rsquo;tis new:<br/>
She blush&rsquo;d, and frown&rsquo;d not, but she strove to speak,<br/>
And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.<br/>
<br/>
The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:<br/>
    The devil &rsquo;s in the moon for mischief; they<br/>
Who call&rsquo;d her CHASTE, methinks, began too soon<br/>
    Their nomenclature; there is not a day,<br/>
The longest, not the twenty-first of June,<br/>
    Sees half the business in a wicked way<br/>
On which three single hours of moonshine smile&mdash;<br/>
And then she looks so modest all the while.<br/>
<br/>
There is a dangerous silence in that hour,<br/>
    A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul<br/>
To open all itself, without the power<br/>
    Of calling wholly back its self-control;<br/>
The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,<br/>
    Sheds beauty and deep softness o&rsquo;er the whole,<br/>
Breathes also to the heart, and o&rsquo;er it throws<br/>
A loving languor, which is not repose.<br/>
<br/>
And Julia sate with Juan, half embraced<br/>
    And half retiring from the glowing arm,<br/>
Which trembled like the bosom where &rsquo;twas placed;<br/>
    Yet still she must have thought there was no harm,<br/>
Or else &rsquo;twere easy to withdraw her waist;<br/>
    But then the situation had its charm,<br/>
And then&mdash;God knows what next&mdash;I can&rsquo;t go on;<br/>
I&rsquo;m almost sorry that I e&rsquo;er begun.<br/>
<br/>
O Plato! Plato! you have paved the way,<br/>
    With your confounded fantasies, to more<br/>
Immoral conduct by the fancied sway<br/>
    Your system feigns o&rsquo;er the controulless core<br/>
Of human hearts, than all the long array<br/>
    Of poets and romancers:&mdash;You&rsquo;re a bore,<br/>
A charlatan, a coxcomb&mdash;and have been,<br/>
At best, no better than a go-between.<br/>
<br/>
And Julia&rsquo;s voice was lost, except in sighs,<br/>
    Until too late for useful conversation;<br/>
The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,<br/>
    I wish indeed they had not had occasion,<br/>
But who, alas! can love, and then be wise?<br/>
    Not that remorse did not oppose temptation;<br/>
A little still she strove, and much repented<br/>
And whispering &lsquo;I will ne&rsquo;er consent&rsquo;&mdash;consented.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis said that Xerxes offer&rsquo;d a reward<br/>
    To those who could invent him a new pleasure:<br/>
Methinks the requisition &rsquo;s rather hard,<br/>
    And must have cost his majesty a treasure:<br/>
For my part, I&rsquo;m a moderate-minded bard,<br/>
    Fond of a little love (which I call leisure);<br/>
I care not for new pleasures, as the old<br/>
Are quite enough for me, so they but hold.<br/>
<br/>
O Pleasure! you are indeed a pleasant thing,<br/>
    Although one must be damn&rsquo;d for you, no doubt:<br/>
I make a resolution every spring<br/>
    Of reformation, ere the year run out,<br/>
But somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,<br/>
    Yet still, I trust it may be kept throughout:<br/>
I&rsquo;m very sorry, very much ashamed,<br/>
And mean, next winter, to be quite reclaim&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
Here my chaste Muse a liberty must take&mdash;<br/>
    Start not! still chaster reader&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be nice hence&mdash;<br/>
Forward, and there is no great cause to quake;<br/>
    This liberty is a poetic licence,<br/>
Which some irregularity may make<br/>
    In the design, and as I have a high sense<br/>
Of Aristotle and the Rules, &rsquo;tis fit<br/>
To beg his pardon when I err a bit.<br/>
<br/>
This licence is to hope the reader will<br/>
    Suppose from June the sixth (the fatal day,<br/>
Without whose epoch my poetic skill<br/>
    For want of facts would all be thrown away),<br/>
But keeping Julia and Don Juan still<br/>
    In sight, that several months have pass&rsquo;d; we&rsquo;ll say<br/>
&rsquo;Twas in November, but I&rsquo;m not so sure<br/>
About the day&mdash;the era &rsquo;s more obscure.<br/>
<br/>
We&rsquo;ll talk of that anon.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis sweet to hear<br/>
    At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep<br/>
The song and oar of Adria&rsquo;s gondolier,<br/>
    By distance mellow&rsquo;d, o&rsquo;er the waters sweep;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis sweet to see the evening star appear;<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis sweet to listen as the night-winds creep<br/>
From leaf to leaf; &rsquo;tis sweet to view on high<br/>
The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis sweet to hear the watch-dog&rsquo;s honest bark<br/>
    Bay deep-mouth&rsquo;d welcome as we draw near home;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis sweet to know there is an eye will mark<br/>
    Our coming, and look brighter when we come;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis sweet to be awaken&rsquo;d by the lark,<br/>
    Or lull&rsquo;d by falling waters; sweet the hum<br/>
Of bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,<br/>
The lisp of children, and their earliest words.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes<br/>
    In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth,<br/>
Purple and gushing: sweet are our escapes<br/>
    From civic revelry to rural mirth;<br/>
Sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,<br/>
    Sweet to the father is his first-born&rsquo;s birth,<br/>
Sweet is revenge&mdash;especially to women,<br/>
Pillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet<br/>
    The unexpected death of some old lady<br/>
Or gentleman of seventy years complete,<br/>
    Who&rsquo;ve made &lsquo;us youth&rsquo; wait too&mdash;too long already<br/>
For an estate, or cash, or country seat,<br/>
    Still breaking, but with stamina so steady<br/>
That all the Israelites are fit to mob its<br/>
Next owner for their double-damn&rsquo;d post-obits.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis sweet to win, no matter how, one&rsquo;s laurels,<br/>
    By blood or ink; &rsquo;tis sweet to put an end<br/>
To strife; &rsquo;tis sometimes sweet to have our quarrels,<br/>
    Particularly with a tiresome friend:<br/>
Sweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;<br/>
    Dear is the helpless creature we defend<br/>
Against the world; and dear the schoolboy spot<br/>
We ne&rsquo;er forget, though there we are forgot.<br/>
<br/>
But sweeter still than this, than these, than all,<br/>
    Is first and passionate love&mdash;it stands alone,<br/>
Like Adam&rsquo;s recollection of his fall;<br/>
    The tree of knowledge has been pluck&rsquo;d&mdash;all &rsquo;s known&mdash;<br/>
And life yields nothing further to recall<br/>
    Worthy of this ambrosial sin, so shown,<br/>
No doubt in fable, as the unforgiven<br/>
Fire which Prometheus filch&rsquo;d for us from heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Man &rsquo;s a strange animal, and makes strange use<br/>
    Of his own nature, and the various arts,<br/>
And likes particularly to produce<br/>
    Some new experiment to show his parts;<br/>
This is the age of oddities let loose,<br/>
    Where different talents find their different marts;<br/>
You&rsquo;d best begin with truth, and when you&rsquo;ve lost your<br/>
Labour, there&rsquo;s a sure market for imposture.<br/>
<br/>
What opposite discoveries we have seen!<br/>
    (Signs of true genius, and of empty pockets.)<br/>
One makes new noses, one a guillotine,<br/>
    One breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets;<br/>
But vaccination certainly has been<br/>
    A kind antithesis to Congreve&rsquo;s rockets,<br/>
With which the Doctor paid off an old pox,<br/>
By borrowing a new one from an ox.<br/>
<br/>
Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;<br/>
    And galvanism has set some corpses grinning,<br/>
But has not answer&rsquo;d like the apparatus<br/>
    Of the Humane Society&rsquo;s beginning<br/>
By which men are unsuffocated gratis:<br/>
    What wondrous new machines have late been spinning!<br/>
I said the small-pox has gone out of late;<br/>
Perhaps it may be follow&rsquo;d by the great.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis said the great came from America;<br/>
    Perhaps it may set out on its return,&mdash;<br/>
The population there so spreads, they say<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis grown high time to thin it in its turn,<br/>
With war, or plague, or famine, any way,<br/>
    So that civilisation they may learn;<br/>
And which in ravage the more loathsome evil is&mdash;<br/>
Their real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis?<br/>
<br/>
This is the patent-age of new inventions<br/>
    For killing bodies, and for saving souls,<br/>
All propagated with the best intentions;<br/>
    Sir Humphry Davy&rsquo;s lantern, by which coals<br/>
Are safely mined for in the mode he mentions,<br/>
    Tombuctoo travels, voyages to the Poles,<br/>
Are ways to benefit mankind, as true,<br/>
Perhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.<br/>
<br/>
Man &rsquo;s a phenomenon, one knows not what,<br/>
    And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis pity though, in this sublime world, that<br/>
    Pleasure &rsquo;s a sin, and sometimes sin &rsquo;s a pleasure;<br/>
Few mortals know what end they would be at,<br/>
    But whether glory, power, or love, or treasure,<br/>
The path is through perplexing ways, and when<br/>
The goal is gain&rsquo;d, we die, you know&mdash;and then&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
What then?&mdash;I do not know, no more do you&mdash;<br/>
    And so good night.&mdash;Return we to our story:<br/>
&rsquo;Twas in November, when fine days are few,<br/>
    And the far mountains wax a little hoary,<br/>
And clap a white cape on their mantles blue;<br/>
    And the sea dashes round the promontory,<br/>
And the loud breaker boils against the rock,<br/>
And sober suns must set at five o&rsquo;clock.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Twas, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;<br/>
    No moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud<br/>
By gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright<br/>
    With the piled wood, round which the family crowd;<br/>
There&rsquo;s something cheerful in that sort of light,<br/>
    Even as a summer sky &rsquo;s without a cloud:<br/>
I&rsquo;m fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,<br/>
A lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Twas midnight&mdash;Donna Julia was in bed,<br/>
    Sleeping, most probably,&mdash;when at her door<br/>
Arose a clatter might awake the dead,<br/>
    If they had never been awoke before,<br/>
And that they have been so we all have read,<br/>
    And are to be so, at the least, once more.--<br/>
The door was fasten&rsquo;d, but with voice and fist<br/>
First knocks were heard, then &lsquo;Madam&mdash;Madam&mdash;hist!<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Madam&mdash;Madam&mdash;here&rsquo;s my master,<br/>
    With more than half the city at his back&mdash;<br/>
Was ever heard of such a curst disaster!<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis not my fault&mdash;I kept good watch&mdash;Alack!<br/>
Do pray undo the bolt a little faster&mdash;<br/>
    They&rsquo;re on the stair just now, and in a crack<br/>
Will all be here; perhaps he yet may fly&mdash;<br/>
Surely the window &rsquo;s not so very high!&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
By this time Don Alfonso was arrived,<br/>
    With torches, friends, and servants in great number;<br/>
The major part of them had long been wived,<br/>
    And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber<br/>
Of any wicked woman, who contrived<br/>
    By stealth her husband&rsquo;s temples to encumber:<br/>
Examples of this kind are so contagious,<br/>
Were one not punish&rsquo;d, all would be outrageous.<br/>
<br/>
I can&rsquo;t tell how, or why, or what suspicion<br/>
    Could enter into Don Alfonso&rsquo;s head;<br/>
But for a cavalier of his condition<br/>
    It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,<br/>
Without a word of previous admonition,<br/>
    To hold a levee round his lady&rsquo;s bed,<br/>
And summon lackeys, arm&rsquo;d with fire and sword,<br/>
To prove himself the thing he most abhorr&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
Poor Donna Julia, starting as from sleep<br/>
    (Mind&mdash;that I do not say&mdash;she had not slept),<br/>
Began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;<br/>
    Her maid Antonia, who was an adept,<br/>
Contrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap,<br/>
    As if she had just now from out them crept:<br/>
I can&rsquo;t tell why she should take all this trouble<br/>
To prove her mistress had been sleeping double.<br/>
<br/>
But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,<br/>
    Appear&rsquo;d like two poor harmless women, who<br/>
Of goblins, but still more of men afraid,<br/>
    Had thought one man might be deterr&rsquo;d by two,<br/>
And therefore side by side were gently laid,<br/>
    Until the hours of absence should run through,<br/>
And truant husband should return, and say,<br/>
&lsquo;My dear, I was the first who came away.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Now Julia found at length a voice, and cried,<br/>
    &lsquo;In heaven&rsquo;s name, Don Alfonso, what d&rsquo; ye mean?<br/>
Has madness seized you? would that I had died<br/>
    Ere such a monster&rsquo;s victim I had been!<br/>
What may this midnight violence betide,<br/>
    A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?<br/>
Dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?<br/>
Search, then, the room!&rsquo;&mdash;Alfonso said, &lsquo;I will.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
He search&rsquo;d, they search&rsquo;d, and rummaged everywhere,<br/>
    Closet and clothes&rsquo; press, chest and window-seat,<br/>
And found much linen, lace, and several pair<br/>
    Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,<br/>
With other articles of ladies fair,<br/>
    To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:<br/>
Arras they prick&rsquo;d and curtains with their swords,<br/>
And wounded several shutters, and some boards.<br/>
<br/>
Under the bed they search&rsquo;d, and there they found&mdash;<br/>
    No matter what&mdash;it was not that they sought;<br/>
They open&rsquo;d windows, gazing if the ground<br/>
    Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;<br/>
And then they stared each other&rsquo;s faces round:<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis odd, not one of all these seekers thought,<br/>
And seems to me almost a sort of blunder,<br/>
Of looking in the bed as well as under.<br/>
<br/>
During this inquisition, Julia&rsquo;s tongue<br/>
    Was not asleep&mdash;&lsquo;Yes, search and search,&rsquo; she cried,<br/>
&lsquo;Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!<br/>
    It was for this that I became a bride!<br/>
For this in silence I have suffer&rsquo;d long<br/>
    A husband like Alfonso at my side;<br/>
But now I&rsquo;ll bear no more, nor here remain,<br/>
If there be law or lawyers in all Spain.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,<br/>
    If ever you indeed deserved the name,<br/>
Is &rsquo;t worthy of your years?&mdash;you have threescore&mdash;<br/>
    Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same&mdash;<br/>
Is &rsquo;t wise or fitting, causeless to explore<br/>
    For facts against a virtuous woman&rsquo;s fame?<br/>
Ungrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,<br/>
How dare you think your lady would go on so?<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Is it for this I have disdain&rsquo;d to hold<br/>
    The common privileges of my sex?<br/>
That I have chosen a confessor so old<br/>
    And deaf, that any other it would vex,<br/>
And never once he has had cause to scold,<br/>
    But found my very innocence perplex<br/>
So much, he always doubted I was married&mdash;<br/>
How sorry you will be when I&rsquo;ve miscarried!<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Was it for this that no Cortejo e&rsquo;er<br/>
    I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?<br/>
Is it for this I scarce went anywhere,<br/>
    Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?<br/>
Is it for this, whate&rsquo;er my suitors were,<br/>
    I favor&rsquo;d none&mdash;nay, was almost uncivil?<br/>
Is it for this that General Count O&rsquo;Reilly,<br/>
Who took Algiers, declares I used him vilely?<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Did not the Italian Musico Cazzani<br/>
    Sing at my heart six months at least in vain?<br/>
Did not his countryman, Count Corniani,<br/>
    Call me the only virtuous wife in Spain?<br/>
Were there not also Russians, English, many?<br/>
    The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,<br/>
And Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,<br/>
Who kill&rsquo;d himself for love (with wine) last year.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Have I not had two bishops at my feet,<br/>
    The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez?<br/>
And is it thus a faithful wife you treat?<br/>
    I wonder in what quarter now the moon is:<br/>
I praise your vast forbearance not to beat<br/>
    Me also, since the time so opportune is&mdash;<br/>
O, valiant man! with sword drawn and cock&rsquo;d trigger,<br/>
Now, tell me, don&rsquo;t you cut a pretty figure?<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Was it for this you took your sudden journey.<br/>
    Under pretence of business indispensable<br/>
With that sublime of rascals your attorney,<br/>
    Whom I see standing there, and looking sensible<br/>
Of having play&rsquo;d the fool? though both I spurn, he<br/>
    Deserves the worst, his conduct &rsquo;s less defensible,<br/>
Because, no doubt, &rsquo;twas for his dirty fee,<br/>
And not from any love to you nor me.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;If he comes here to take a deposition,<br/>
    By all means let the gentleman proceed;<br/>
You&rsquo;ve made the apartment in a fit condition:<br/>
    There&rsquo;s pen and ink for you, sir, when you need&mdash;<br/>
Let every thing be noted with precision,<br/>
    I would not you for nothing should be fee&rsquo;d&mdash;<br/>
But, as my maid &rsquo;s undrest, pray turn your spies out.&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; sobb&rsquo;d Antonia, &lsquo;I could tear their eyes out.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;There is the closet, there the toilet, there<br/>
    The antechamber&mdash;search them under, over;<br/>
There is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,<br/>
    The chimney&mdash;which would really hold a lover.<br/>
I wish to sleep, and beg you will take care<br/>
    And make no further noise, till you discover<br/>
The secret cavern of this lurking treasure&mdash;<br/>
And when &rsquo;tis found, let me, too, have that pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;And now, Hidalgo! now that you have thrown<br/>
    Doubt upon me, confusion over all,<br/>
Pray have the courtesy to make it known<br/>
    Who is the man you search for? how d&rsquo; ye cal<br/>
Him? what &rsquo;s his lineage? let him but be shown&mdash;<br/>
    I hope he &rsquo;s young and handsome&mdash;is he tall?<br/>
Tell me&mdash;and be assured, that since you stain<br/>
My honour thus, it shall not be in vain.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,<br/>
    At that age he would be too old for slaughter,<br/>
Or for so young a husband&rsquo;s jealous fears<br/>
    (Antonia! let me have a glass of water).<br/>
I am ashamed of having shed these tears,<br/>
    They are unworthy of my father&rsquo;s daughter;<br/>
My mother dream&rsquo;d not in my natal hour<br/>
That I should fall into a monster&rsquo;s power.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Perhaps &rsquo;tis of Antonia you are jealous,<br/>
    You saw that she was sleeping by my side<br/>
When you broke in upon us with your fellows:<br/>
    Look where you please&mdash;we&rsquo;ve nothing, sir, to hide;<br/>
Only another time, I trust, you&rsquo;ll tell us,<br/>
    Or for the sake of decency abide<br/>
A moment at the door, that we may be<br/>
Drest to receive so much good company.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;<br/>
    The little I have said may serve to show<br/>
The guileless heart in silence may grieve o&rsquo;er<br/>
    The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:<br/>
I leave you to your conscience as before,<br/>
    &rsquo;Twill one day ask you why you used me so?<br/>
God grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!-<br/>
Antonia! where&rsquo;s my pocket-handkerchief?&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
She ceased, and turn&rsquo;d upon her pillow; pale<br/>
    She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,<br/>
Like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,<br/>
    Waved and o&rsquo;ershading her wan cheek, appears<br/>
Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail,<br/>
    To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears<br/>
Its snow through all;&mdash;her soft lips lie apart,<br/>
And louder than her breathing beats her heart.<br/>
<br/>
The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;<br/>
    Antonia bustled round the ransack&rsquo;d room,<br/>
And, turning up her nose, with looks abused<br/>
    Her master and his myrmidons, of whom<br/>
Not one, except the attorney, was amused;<br/>
    He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,<br/>
So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,<br/>
Knowing they must be settled by the laws.<br/>
<br/>
With prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,<br/>
    Following Antonia&rsquo;s motions here and there,<br/>
With much suspicion in his attitude;<br/>
    For reputations he had little care;<br/>
So that a suit or action were made good,<br/>
    Small pity had he for the young and fair,<br/>
And ne&rsquo;er believed in negatives, till these<br/>
Were proved by competent false witnesses.<br/>
<br/>
But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,<br/>
    And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;<br/>
When, after searching in five hundred nooks,<br/>
    And treating a young wife with so much rigour,<br/>
He gain&rsquo;d no point, except some self-rebukes,<br/>
    Added to those his lady with such vigour<br/>
Had pour&rsquo;d upon him for the last half-hour,<br/>
Quick, thick, and heavy&mdash;as a thunder-shower.<br/>
<br/>
At first he tried to hammer an excuse,<br/>
    To which the sole reply was tears and sobs,<br/>
And indications of hysterics, whose<br/>
    Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,<br/>
Gasps, and whatever else the owners choose:<br/>
    Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job&rsquo;s;<br/>
He saw too, in perspective, her relations,<br/>
And then he tried to muster all his patience.<br/>
<br/>
He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,<br/>
    But sage Antonia cut him short before<br/>
The anvil of his speech received the hammer,<br/>
    With &lsquo;Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,<br/>
Or madam dies.&rsquo;&mdash;Alfonso mutter&rsquo;d, &lsquo;D&mdash;n her,&rsquo;<br/>
    But nothing else, the time of words was o&rsquo;er;<br/>
He cast a rueful look or two, and did,<br/>
He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.<br/>
<br/>
With him retired his &lsquo;posse comitatus,&rsquo;<br/>
    The attorney last, who linger&rsquo;d near the door<br/>
Reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as<br/>
    Antonia let him&mdash;not a little sore<br/>
At this most strange and unexplain&rsquo;d &lsquo;hiatus&rsquo;<br/>
    In Don Alfonso&rsquo;s facts, which just now wore<br/>
An awkward look; as he revolved the case,<br/>
The door was fasten&rsquo;d in his legal face.<br/>
<br/>
No sooner was it bolted, than&mdash;Oh shame!<br/>
    O sin! Oh sorrow! and oh womankind!<br/>
How can you do such things and keep your fame,<br/>
    Unless this world, and t&rsquo; other too, be blind?<br/>
Nothing so dear as an unfilch&rsquo;d good name!<br/>
    But to proceed&mdash;for there is more behind:<br/>
With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,<br/>
Young Juan slipp&rsquo;d half-smother&rsquo;d, from the bed.<br/>
<br/>
He had been hid&mdash;I don&rsquo;t pretend to say<br/>
    How, nor can I indeed describe the where&mdash;<br/>
Young, slender, and pack&rsquo;d easily, he lay,<br/>
    No doubt, in little compass, round or square;<br/>
But pity him I neither must nor may<br/>
    His suffocation by that pretty pair;<br/>
&rsquo;Twere better, sure, to die so, than be shut<br/>
With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.<br/>
<br/>
And, secondly, I pity not, because<br/>
    He had no business to commit a sin,<br/>
Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws,<br/>
    At least &rsquo;twas rather early to begin;<br/>
But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws<br/>
    So much as when we call our old debts in<br/>
At sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,<br/>
And find a deuced balance with the devil.<br/>
<br/>
Of his position I can give no notion:<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis written in the Hebrew Chronicle,<br/>
How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,<br/>
    Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,<br/>
When old King David&rsquo;s blood grew dull in motion,<br/>
    And that the medicine answer&rsquo;d very well;<br/>
Perhaps &rsquo;twas in a different way applied,<br/>
For David lived, but Juan nearly died.<br/>
<br/>
What &rsquo;s to be done? Alfonso will be back<br/>
    The moment he has sent his fools away.<br/>
Antonia&rsquo;s skill was put upon the rack,<br/>
    But no device could be brought into play&mdash;<br/>
And how to parry the renew&rsquo;d attack?<br/>
    Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:<br/>
Antonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,<br/>
But press&rsquo;d her bloodless lip to Juan&rsquo;s cheek.<br/>
<br/>
He turn&rsquo;d his lip to hers, and with his hand<br/>
    Call&rsquo;d back the tangles of her wandering hair;<br/>
Even then their love they could not all command,<br/>
    And half forgot their danger and despair:<br/>
Antonia&rsquo;s patience now was at a stand&mdash;<br/>
    &lsquo;Come, come, &rsquo;tis no time now for fooling there,&rsquo;<br/>
She whisper&rsquo;d, in great wrath&mdash;&lsquo;I must deposit<br/>
This pretty gentleman within the closet:<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night&mdash;<br/>
    Who can have put my master in this mood?<br/>
What will become on &rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;m in such a fright,<br/>
    The devil &rsquo;s in the urchin, and no good&mdash;<br/>
Is this a time for giggling? this a plight?<br/>
    Why, don&rsquo;t you know that it may end in blood?<br/>
You&rsquo;ll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,<br/>
My mistress all, for that half-girlish face.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Had it but been for a stout cavalier<br/>
    Of twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste)&mdash;<br/>
But for a child, what piece of work is here!<br/>
    I really, madam, wonder at your taste<br/>
(Come, sir, get in)&mdash;my master must be near:<br/>
    There, for the present, at the least, he&rsquo;s fast,<br/>
And if we can but till the morning keep<br/>
Our counsel&mdash;(Juan, mind, you must not sleep).&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Now, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,<br/>
    Closed the oration of the trusty maid:<br/>
She loiter&rsquo;d, and he told her to be gone,<br/>
    An order somewhat sullenly obey&rsquo;d;<br/>
However, present remedy was none,<br/>
    And no great good seem&rsquo;d answer&rsquo;d if she stay&rsquo;d:<br/>
Regarding both with slow and sidelong view,<br/>
She snuff&rsquo;d the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.<br/>
<br/>
Alfonso paused a minute&mdash;then begun<br/>
    Some strange excuses for his late proceeding;<br/>
He would not justify what he had done,<br/>
    To say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;<br/>
But there were ample reasons for it, none<br/>
    Of which he specified in this his pleading:<br/>
His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,<br/>
Of rhetoric, which the learn&rsquo;d call &lsquo;rigmarole.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Julia said nought; though all the while there rose<br/>
    A ready answer, which at once enables<br/>
A matron, who her husband&rsquo;s foible knows,<br/>
    By a few timely words to turn the tables,<br/>
Which, if it does not silence, still must pose,&mdash;<br/>
    Even if it should comprise a pack of fables;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis to retort with firmness, and when he<br/>
Suspects with one, do you reproach with three.<br/>
<br/>
Julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,&mdash;<br/>
    Alfonso&rsquo;s loves with Inez were well known,<br/>
But whether &rsquo;twas that one&rsquo;s own guilt confounds&mdash;<br/>
    But that can&rsquo;t be, as has been often shown,<br/>
A lady with apologies abounds;&mdash;<br/>
    It might be that her silence sprang alone<br/>
From delicacy to Don Juan&rsquo;s ear,<br/>
To whom she knew his mother&rsquo;s fame was dear.<br/>
<br/>
There might be one more motive, which makes two;<br/>
    Alfonso ne&rsquo;er to Juan had alluded,&mdash;<br/>
Mention&rsquo;d his jealousy but never who<br/>
    Had been the happy lover, he concluded,<br/>
Conceal&rsquo;d amongst his premises; &rsquo;tis true,<br/>
    His mind the more o&rsquo;er this its mystery brooded;<br/>
To speak of Inez now were, one may say,<br/>
Like throwing Juan in Alfonso&rsquo;s way.<br/>
<br/>
A hint, in tender cases, is enough;<br/>
    Silence is best, besides there is a tact<br/>
(That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,<br/>
    But it will serve to keep my verse compact)&mdash;<br/>
Which keeps, when push&rsquo;d by questions rather rough,<br/>
    A lady always distant from the fact:<br/>
The charming creatures lie with such a grace,<br/>
There&rsquo;s nothing so becoming to the face.<br/>
<br/>
They blush, and we believe them; at least I<br/>
    Have always done so; &rsquo;tis of no great use,<br/>
In any case, attempting a reply,<br/>
    For then their eloquence grows quite profuse;<br/>
And when at length they&rsquo;re out of breath, they sigh,<br/>
    And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose<br/>
A tear or two, and then we make it up;<br/>
And then&mdash;and then&mdash;and then&mdash;sit down and sup.<br/>
<br/>
Alfonso closed his speech, and begg&rsquo;d her pardon,<br/>
    Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,<br/>
And laid conditions he thought very hard on,<br/>
    Denying several little things he wanted:<br/>
He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,<br/>
    With useless penitence perplex&rsquo;d and haunted,<br/>
Beseeching she no further would refuse,<br/>
When, lo! he stumbled o&rsquo;er a pair of shoes.<br/>
<br/>
A pair of shoes!&mdash;what then? not much, if they<br/>
    Are such as fit with ladies&rsquo; feet, but these<br/>
(No one can tell how much I grieve to say)<br/>
    Were masculine; to see them, and to seize,<br/>
Was but a moment&rsquo;s act.&mdash;Ah! well-a-day!<br/>
    My teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze&mdash;<br/>
Alfonso first examined well their fashion,<br/>
And then flew out into another passion.<br/>
<br/>
He left the room for his relinquish&rsquo;d sword,<br/>
    And Julia instant to the closet flew.<br/>
&lsquo;Fly, Juan, fly! for heaven&rsquo;s sake&mdash;not a word&mdash;<br/>
    The door is open&mdash;you may yet slip through<br/>
The passage you so often have explored&mdash;<br/>
    Here is the garden-key&mdash;Fly&mdash;fly&mdash;Adieu!<br/>
Haste&mdash;haste! I hear Alfonso&rsquo;s hurrying feet&mdash;<br/>
Day has not broke&mdash;there&rsquo;s no one in the street:<br/>
<br/>
None can say that this was not good advice,<br/>
    The only mischief was, it came too late;<br/>
Of all experience &rsquo;tis the usual price,<br/>
    A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:<br/>
Juan had reach&rsquo;d the room-door in a. trice,<br/>
    And might have done so by the garden-gate,<br/>
But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,<br/>
Who threaten&rsquo;d death&mdash;so Juan knock&rsquo;d him down.<br/>
<br/>
Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light;<br/>
    Antonia cried out &lsquo;Rape!&rsquo; and Julia &lsquo;Fire!&rsquo;<br/>
But not a servant stirr&rsquo;d to aid the fight.<br/>
    Alfonso, pommell&rsquo;d to his heart&rsquo;s desire,<br/>
Swore lustily he&rsquo;d be revenged this night;<br/>
    And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;<br/>
His blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,<br/>
And not at all disposed to prove a martyr.<br/>
<br/>
Alfonso&rsquo;s sword had dropp&rsquo;d ere he could draw it,<br/>
    And they continued battling hand to hand,<br/>
For Juan very luckily ne&rsquo;er saw it;<br/>
    His temper not being under great command,<br/>
If at that moment he had chanced to claw it,<br/>
    Alfonso&rsquo;s days had not been in the land<br/>
Much longer.&mdash;Think of husbands&rsquo;, lovers&rsquo; lives!<br/>
And how ye may be doubly widows&mdash;wives!<br/>
<br/>
Alfonso grappled to detain the foe,<br/>
    And Juan throttled him to get away,<br/>
And blood (&rsquo;twas from the nose) began to flow;<br/>
    At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,<br/>
Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,<br/>
    And then his only garment quite gave way;<br/>
He fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,<br/>
I doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.<br/>
<br/>
Lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found<br/>
    An awkward spectacle their eyes before;<br/>
Antonia in hysterics, Julia swoon&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;<br/>
Some half-torn drapery scatter&rsquo;d on the ground,<br/>
    Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more:<br/>
Juan the gate gain&rsquo;d, turn&rsquo;d the key about,<br/>
And liking not the inside, lock&rsquo;d the out.<br/>
<br/>
Here ends this canto.&mdash;Need I sing, or say,<br/>
    How Juan naked, favour&rsquo;d by the night,<br/>
Who favours what she should not, found his way,<br/>
    And reach&rsquo;d his home in an unseemly plight?<br/>
The pleasant scandal which arose next day,<br/>
    The nine days&rsquo; wonder which was brought to light,<br/>
And how Alfonso sued for a divorce,<br/>
Were in the English newspapers, of course.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to see the whole proceedings,<br/>
    The depositions, and the cause at full,<br/>
The names of all the witnesses, the pleadings<br/>
    Of counsel to nonsuit, or to annul,<br/>
There&rsquo;s more than one edition, and the readings<br/>
    Are various, but they none of them are dull;<br/>
The best is that in short-hand ta&rsquo;en by Gurney,<br/>
Who to Madrid on purpose made a journey.<br/>
<br/>
But Donna Inez, to divert the train<br/>
    Of one of the most circulating scandals<br/>
That had for centuries been known in Spain,<br/>
    At least since the retirement of the Vandals,<br/>
First vow&rsquo;d (and never had she vow&rsquo;d in vain)<br/>
    To Virgin Mary several pounds of candles;<br/>
And then, by the advice of some old ladies,<br/>
She sent her son to be shipp&rsquo;d off from Cadiz.<br/>
<br/>
She had resolved that he should travel through<br/>
    All European climes, by land or sea,<br/>
To mend his former morals, and get new,<br/>
    Especially in France and Italy<br/>
(At least this is the thing most people do).<br/>
    Julia was sent into a convent: she<br/>
Grieved, but, perhaps, her feelings may be better<br/>
Shown in the following copy of her Letter:&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;They tell me &rsquo;tis decided; you depart:<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis wise&mdash;&rsquo;tis well, but not the less a pain;<br/>
I have no further claim on your young heart,<br/>
    Mine is the victim, and would be again;<br/>
To love too much has been the only art<br/>
    I used;&mdash;I write in haste, and if a stain<br/>
Be on this sheet, &rsquo;tis not what it appears;<br/>
My eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;I loved, I love you, for this love have lost<br/>
    State, station, heaven, mankind&rsquo;s, my own esteem,<br/>
And yet can not regret what it hath cost,<br/>
    So dear is still the memory of that dream;<br/>
Yet, if I name my guilt, &rsquo;tis not to boast,<br/>
    None can deem harshlier of me than I deem:<br/>
I trace this scrawl because I cannot rest&mdash;<br/>
I&rsquo;ve nothing to reproach, or to request.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Man&rsquo;s love is of man&rsquo;s life a thing apart,<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis woman&rsquo;s whole existence; man may range<br/>
The court, camp, church, the vessel, and the mart;<br/>
    Sword, gown, gain, glory, offer in exchange<br/>
Pride, fame, ambition, to fill up his heart,<br/>
    And few there are whom these cannot estrange;<br/>
Men have all these resources, we but one,<br/>
To love again, and be again undone.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,<br/>
    Beloved and loving many; all is o&rsquo;er<br/>
For me on earth, except some years to hide<br/>
    My shame and sorrow deep in my heart&rsquo;s core;<br/>
These I could bear, but cannot cast aside<br/>
    The passion which still rages as before&mdash;<br/>
And so farewell&mdash;forgive me, love me&mdash;No,<br/>
That word is idle now&mdash;but let it go.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;<br/>
    But still I think I can collect my mind;<br/>
My blood still rushes where my spirit &rsquo;s set,<br/>
    As roll the waves before the settled wind;<br/>
My heart is feminine, nor can forget&mdash;<br/>
    To all, except one image, madly blind;<br/>
So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,<br/>
As vibrates my fond heart to my fix&rsquo;d soul.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;I have no more to say, but linger still,<br/>
    And dare not set my seal upon this sheet,<br/>
And yet I may as well the task fulfil,<br/>
    My misery can scarce be more complete:<br/>
I had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;<br/>
    Death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,<br/>
And I must even survive this last adieu,<br/>
And bear with life, to love and pray for you!&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
This note was written upon gilt-edged paper<br/>
    With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new:<br/>
Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper,<br/>
    It trembled as magnetic needles do,<br/>
And yet she did not let one tear escape her;<br/>
    The seal a sun-flower; &lsquo;Elle vous suit partout,&rsquo;<br/>
The motto cut upon a white cornelian;<br/>
The wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.<br/>
<br/>
This was Don Juan&rsquo;s earliest scrape; but whether<br/>
    I shall proceed with his adventures is<br/>
Dependent on the public altogether;<br/>
    We&rsquo;ll see, however, what they say to this:<br/>
Their favour in an author&rsquo;s cap &rsquo;s a feather,<br/>
    And no great mischief &rsquo;s done by their caprice;<br/>
And if their approbation we experience,<br/>
Perhaps they&rsquo;ll have some more about a year hence.<br/>
<br/>
My poem &rsquo;s epic, and is meant to be<br/>
    Divided in twelve books; each book containing,<br/>
With love, and war, a heavy gale at sea,<br/>
    A list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,<br/>
New characters; the episodes are three:<br/>
    A panoramic view of hell &rsquo;s in training,<br/>
After the style of Virgil and of Homer,<br/>
So that my name of Epic &rsquo;s no misnomer.<br/>
<br/>
All these things will be specified in time,<br/>
    With strict regard to Aristotle&rsquo;s rules,<br/>
The Vade Mecum of the true sublime,<br/>
    Which makes so many poets, and some fools:<br/>
Prose poets like blank-verse, I&rsquo;m fond of rhyme,<br/>
    Good workmen never quarrel with their tools;<br/>
I&rsquo;ve got new mythological machinery,<br/>
And very handsome supernatural scenery.<br/>
<br/>
There&rsquo;s only one slight difference between<br/>
    Me and my epic brethren gone before,<br/>
And here the advantage is my own, I ween<br/>
    (Not that I have not several merits more,<br/>
But this will more peculiarly be seen);<br/>
    They so embellish, that &rsquo;tis quite a bore<br/>
Their labyrinth of fables to thread through,<br/>
Whereas this story &rsquo;s actually true.<br/>
<br/>
If any person doubt it, I appeal<br/>
    To history, tradition, and to facts,<br/>
To newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,<br/>
    To plays in five, and operas in three acts;<br/>
All these confirm my statement a good deal,<br/>
    But that which more completely faith exacts<br/>
Is that myself, and several now in Seville,<br/>
Saw Juan&rsquo;s last elopement with the devil.<br/>
<br/>
If ever I should condescend to prose,<br/>
    I&rsquo;ll write poetical commandments, which<br/>
Shall supersede beyond all doubt all those<br/>
    That went before; in these I shall enrich<br/>
My text with many things that no one knows,<br/>
    And carry precept to the highest pitch:<br/>
I&rsquo;ll call the work &lsquo;Longinus o&rsquo;er a Bottle,<br/>
Or, Every Poet his own Aristotle.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Thou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;<br/>
    Thou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey;<br/>
Because the first is crazed beyond all hope,<br/>
    The second drunk, the third so quaint and mouthy:<br/>
With Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,<br/>
    And Campbell&rsquo;s Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:<br/>
Thou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor<br/>
Commit&mdash;flirtation with the muse of Moore.<br/>
<br/>
Thou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby&rsquo;s Muse,<br/>
    His Pegasus, nor anything that &rsquo;s his;<br/>
Thou shalt not bear false witness like &lsquo;the Blues&rsquo;<br/>
    (There&rsquo;s one, at least, is very fond of this);<br/>
Thou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:<br/>
    This is true criticism, and you may kiss&mdash;<br/>
Exactly as you please, or not,&mdash;the rod;<br/>
But if you don’t, I’ll lay it on, by G&mdash;d!<br/>
<br/>
If any person should presume to assert<br/>
    This story is not moral, first, I pray,<br/>
That they will not cry out before they&rsquo;re hurt,<br/>
    Then that they&rsquo;ll read it o&rsquo;er again, and say<br/>
(But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)<br/>
    That this is not a moral tale, though gay;<br/>
Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show<br/>
The very place where wicked people go.<br/>
<br/>
If, after all, there should be some so blind<br/>
    To their own good this warning to despise,<br/>
Led by some tortuosity of mind,<br/>
    Not to believe my verse and their own eyes,<br/>
And cry that they &lsquo;the moral cannot find,&rsquo;<br/>
    I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;<br/>
Should captains the remark, or critics, make,<br/>
They also lie too&mdash;under a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
The public approbation I expect,<br/>
    And beg they&rsquo;ll take my word about the moral,<br/>
Which I with their amusement will connect<br/>
    (So children cutting teeth receive a coral);<br/>
Meantime, they&rsquo;ll doubtless please to recollect<br/>
    My epical pretensions to the laurel:<br/>
For fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,<br/>
I&rsquo;ve bribed my grandmother&rsquo;s review&mdash;the British.<br/>
<br/>
I sent it in a letter to the Editor,<br/>
    Who thank&rsquo;d me duly by return of post&mdash;<br/>
I&rsquo;m for a handsome article his creditor;<br/>
    Yet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,<br/>
And break a promise after having made it her,<br/>
    Denying the receipt of what it cost,<br/>
And smear his page with gall instead of honey,<br/>
All I can say is&mdash;that he had the money.<br/>
<br/>
I think that with this holy new alliance<br/>
    I may ensure the public, and defy<br/>
All other magazines of art or science,<br/>
    Daily, or monthly, or three monthly; I<br/>
Have not essay&rsquo;d to multiply their clients,<br/>
    Because they tell me &rsquo;twere in vain to try,<br/>
And that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly<br/>
Treat a dissenting author very martyrly.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Non ego hoc ferrem calida juventa<br/>
    Consule Planco,&rsquo; Horace said, and so<br/>
Say I; by which quotation there is meant a<br/>
    Hint that some six or seven good years ago<br/>
(Long ere I dreamt of dating from the Brenta)<br/>
    I was most ready to return a blow,<br/>
And would not brook at all this sort of thing<br/>
In my hot youth&mdash;when George the Third was King.<br/>
<br/>
But now at thirty years my hair is grey<br/>
    (I wonder what it will be like at forty?<br/>
I thought of a peruke the other day)&mdash;<br/>
    My heart is not much greener; and, in short, I<br/>
Have squander&rsquo;d my whole summer while &rsquo;twas May,<br/>
    And feel no more the spirit to retort; I<br/>
Have spent my life, both interest and principal,<br/>
And deem not, what I deem&rsquo;d, my soul invincible.<br/>
<br/>
No more&mdash;no more&mdash;Oh! never more on me<br/>
    The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,<br/>
Which out of all the lovely things we see<br/>
    Extracts emotions beautiful and new,<br/>
Hived in our bosoms like the bag o&rsquo; the bee:<br/>
    Think&rsquo;st thou the honey with those objects grew?<br/>
Alas! &rsquo;twas not in them, but in thy power<br/>
To double even the sweetness of a flower.<br/>
<br/>
No more&mdash;no more&mdash;Oh! never more, my heart,<br/>
    Canst thou be my sole world, my universe!<br/>
Once all in all, but now a thing apart,<br/>
    Thou canst not be my blessing or my curse:<br/>
The illusion &rsquo;s gone for ever, and thou art<br/>
    Insensible, I trust, but none the worse,<br/>
And in thy stead I&rsquo;ve got a deal of judgment,<br/>
Though heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment.<br/>
<br/>
My days of love are over; me no more<br/>
    The charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,<br/>
Can make the fool of which they made before,&mdash;<br/>
    In short, I must not lead the life I did do;<br/>
The credulous hope of mutual minds is o&rsquo;er,<br/>
    The copious use of claret is forbid too,<br/>
So for a good old-gentlemanly vice,<br/>
I think I must take up with avarice.<br/>
<br/>
Ambition was my idol, which was broken<br/>
    Before the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;<br/>
And the two last have left me many a token<br/>
    O&rsquo;er which reflection may be made at leisure:<br/>
Now, like Friar Bacon&rsquo;s brazen head, I&rsquo;ve spoken,<br/>
    &lsquo;Time is, Time was, Time &rsquo;s past:&rsquo;&mdash;a chymic treasure<br/>
Is glittering youth, which I have spent betimes&mdash;<br/>
My heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.<br/>
<br/>
What is the end of Fame? &rsquo;tis but to fill<br/>
    A certain portion of uncertain paper:<br/>
Some liken it to climbing up a hill,<br/>
    Whose summit, like all hills, is lost in vapour;<br/>
For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,<br/>
    And bards burn what they call their &lsquo;midnight taper,&rsquo;<br/>
To have, when the original is dust,<br/>
A name, a wretched picture, and worse bust.<br/>
<br/>
What are the hopes of man? Old Egypt&rsquo;s King<br/>
    Cheops erected the first pyramid<br/>
And largest, thinking it was just the thing<br/>
    To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;<br/>
But somebody or other rummaging,<br/>
    Burglariously broke his coffin&rsquo;s lid:<br/>
Let not a monument give you or me hopes,<br/>
Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.<br/>
<br/>
But I being fond of true philosophy,<br/>
    Say very often to myself, &lsquo;Alas!<br/>
All things that have been born were born to die,<br/>
    And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;<br/>
You&rsquo;ve pass&rsquo;d your youth not so unpleasantly,<br/>
    And if you had it o&rsquo;er again&mdash;&rsquo;twould pass&mdash;<br/>
So thank your stars that matters are no worse,<br/>
And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
But for the present, gentle reader! and<br/>
    Still gentler purchaser! the bard&mdash;that &rsquo;s I&mdash;<br/>
Must, with permission, shake you by the hand,<br/>
    And so &lsquo;Your humble servant, and good-b&rsquo;ye!&rsquo;<br/>
We meet again, if we should understand<br/>
    Each other; and if not, I shall not try<br/>
Your patience further than by this short sample&mdash;<br/>
&rsquo;Twere well if others follow&rsquo;d my example.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Go, little book, from this my solitude!<br/>
    I cast thee on the waters&mdash;go thy ways!<br/>
And if, as I believe, thy vein be good,<br/>
    The world will find thee after many days.&rsquo;<br/>
When Southey&rsquo;s read, and Wordsworth understood,<br/>
    I can&rsquo;t help putting in my claim to praise&mdash;<br/>
The four first rhymes are Southey&rsquo;s every line:<br/>
For God&rsquo;s sake, reader! take them not for mine.<br/>

CANTO THE SECOND.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
O ye! who teach the ingenuous youth of nations,<br/>
    Holland, France, England, Germany, or Spain,<br/>
I pray ye flog them upon all occasions,<br/>
    It mends their morals, never mind the pain:<br/>
The best of mothers and of educations<br/>
    In Juan&rsquo;s case were but employ&rsquo;d in vain,<br/>
Since, in a way that &rsquo;s rather of the oddest, he<br/>
Became divested of his native modesty.<br/>
<br/>
Had he but been placed at a public school,<br/>
    In the third form, or even in the fourth,<br/>
His daily task had kept his fancy cool,<br/>
    At least, had he been nurtured in the north;<br/>
Spain may prove an exception to the rule,<br/>
    But then exceptions always prove its worth&mdash;<br/>
A lad of sixteen causing a divorce<br/>
Puzzled his tutors very much, of course.<br/>
<br/>
I can&rsquo;t say that it puzzles me at all,<br/>
    If all things be consider&rsquo;d: first, there was<br/>
His lady&mdash;mother, mathematical,<br/>
    A&mdash;never mind; his tutor, an old ass;<br/>
A pretty woman (that &rsquo;s quite natural,<br/>
    Or else the thing had hardly come to pass);<br/>
A husband rather old, not much in unity<br/>
With his young wife&mdash;a time, and opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
Well&mdash;well, the world must turn upon its axis,<br/>
    And all mankind turn with it, heads or tails,<br/>
And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,<br/>
    And as the veering wind shifts, shift our sails;<br/>
The king commands us, and the doctor quacks us,<br/>
    The priest instructs, and so our life exhales,<br/>
A little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,<br/>
Fighting, devotion, dust,&mdash;perhaps a name.<br/>
<br/>
I said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz&mdash;<br/>
    A pretty town, I recollect it well&mdash;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis there the mart of the colonial trade is<br/>
    (Or was, before Peru learn&rsquo;d to rebel),<br/>
And such sweet girls&mdash;I mean, such graceful ladies,<br/>
    Their very walk would make your bosom swell;<br/>
I can&rsquo;t describe it, though so much it strike,<br/>
Nor liken it&mdash;I never saw the like:<br/>
<br/>
An Arab horse, a stately stag, a barb<br/>
    New broke, a cameleopard, a gazelle,<br/>
No&mdash;none of these will do;&mdash;and then their garb!<br/>
    Their veil and petticoat&mdash;Alas! to dwell<br/>
Upon such things would very near absorb<br/>
    A canto&mdash;then their feet and ankles,&mdash;well,<br/>
Thank Heaven I&rsquo;ve got no metaphor quite ready<br/>
(And so, my sober Muse&mdash;come, let &rsquo;s be steady&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Chaste Muse!&mdash;well, if you must, you must)&mdash;the veil<br/>
    Thrown back a moment with the glancing hand,<br/>
While the o&rsquo;erpowering eye, that turns you pale,<br/>
    Flashes into the heart:&mdash;All sunny land<br/>
Of love! when I forget you, may I fail<br/>
    To&mdash;say my prayers&mdash;but never was there plann&rsquo;d<br/>
A dress through which the eyes give such a volley,<br/>
Excepting the Venetian Fazzioli.<br/>
<br/>
But to our tale: the Donna Inez sent<br/>
    Her son to Cadiz only to embark;<br/>
To stay there had not answer&rsquo;d her intent,<br/>
    But why?&mdash;we leave the reader in the dark&mdash;<br/>
&rsquo;Twas for a voyage that the young man was meant,<br/>
    As if a Spanish ship were Noah&rsquo;s ark,<br/>
To wean him from the wickedness of earth,<br/>
And send him like a dove of promise forth.<br/>
<br/>
Don Juan bade his valet pack his things<br/>
    According to direction, then received<br/>
A lecture and some money: for four springs<br/>
    He was to travel; and though Inez grieved<br/>
(As every kind of parting has its stings),<br/>
    She hoped he would improve&mdash;perhaps believed:<br/>
A letter, too, she gave (he never read it)<br/>
Of good advice&mdash;and two or three of credit.<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, to pass her hours away,<br/>
    Brave Inez now set up a Sunday school<br/>
For naughty children, who would rather play<br/>
    (Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;<br/>
Infants of three years old were taught that day,<br/>
    Dunces were whipt, or set upon a stool:<br/>
The great success of Juan&rsquo;s education,<br/>
Spurr&rsquo;d her to teach another generation.<br/>
<br/>
Juan embark&rsquo;d&mdash;the ship got under way,<br/>
    The wind was fair, the water passing rough:<br/>
A devil of a sea rolls in that bay,<br/>
    As I, who&rsquo;ve cross&rsquo;d it oft, know well enough;<br/>
And, standing upon deck, the dashing spray<br/>
    Flies in one&rsquo;s face, and makes it weather-tough:<br/>
And there he stood to take, and take again,<br/>
His first&mdash;perhaps his last&mdash;farewell of Spain.<br/>
<br/>
I can&rsquo;t but say it is an awkward sight<br/>
    To see one&rsquo;s native land receding through<br/>
The growing waters; it unmans one quite,<br/>
    Especially when life is rather new:<br/>
I recollect Great Britain&rsquo;s coast looks white,<br/>
    But almost every other country &rsquo;s blue,<br/>
When gazing on them, mystified by distance,<br/>
We enter on our nautical existence.<br/>
<br/>
So Juan stood, bewilder&rsquo;d on the deck:<br/>
    The wind sung, cordage strain&rsquo;d, and sailors swore,<br/>
And the ship creak&rsquo;d, the town became a speck,<br/>
    From which away so fair and fast they bore.<br/>
The best of remedies is a beef-steak<br/>
    Against sea-sickness: try it, sir, before<br/>
You sneer, and I assure you this is true,<br/>
For I have found it answer&mdash;so may you.<br/>
<br/>
Don Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,<br/>
    Beheld his native Spain receding far:<br/>
First partings form a lesson hard to learn,<br/>
    Even nations feel this when they go to war;<br/>
There is a sort of unexprest concern,<br/>
    A kind of shock that sets one&rsquo;s heart ajar:<br/>
At leaving even the most unpleasant people<br/>
And places, one keeps looking at the steeple.<br/>
<br/>
But Juan had got many things to leave,<br/>
    His mother, and a mistress, and no wife,<br/>
So that he had much better cause to grieve<br/>
    Than many persons more advanced in life;<br/>
And if we now and then a sigh must heave<br/>
    At quitting even those we quit in strife,<br/>
No doubt we weep for those the heart endears&mdash;<br/>
That is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.<br/>
<br/>
So Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews<br/>
    By Babel&rsquo;s waters, still remembering Sion:<br/>
I&rsquo;d weep,&mdash;but mine is not a weeping Muse,<br/>
    And such light griefs are not a thing to die on;<br/>
Young men should travel, if but to amuse<br/>
    Themselves; and the next time their servants tie on<br/>
Behind their carriages their new portmanteau,<br/>
Perhaps it may be lined with this my canto.<br/>
<br/>
And Juan wept, and much he sigh&rsquo;d and thought,<br/>
    While his salt tears dropp&rsquo;d into the salt sea,<br/>
&lsquo;Sweets to the sweet&rsquo; (I like so much to quote;<br/>
    You must excuse this extract, &rsquo;tis where she,<br/>
The Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought<br/>
    Flowers to the grave); and, sobbing often, he<br/>
Reflected on his present situation,<br/>
And seriously resolved on reformation.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!&rsquo; he cried,<br/>
    &lsquo;Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,<br/>
But die, as many an exiled heart hath died,<br/>
    Of its own thirst to see again thy shore:<br/>
Farewell, where Guadalquivir&rsquo;s waters glide!<br/>
    Farewell, my mother! and, since all is o&rsquo;er,<br/>
Farewell, too, dearest Julia!&mdash;(Here he drew<br/>
Her letter out again, and read it through.)<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;And, oh! if e&rsquo;er I should forget, I swear&mdash;<br/>
    But that &rsquo;s impossible, and cannot be&mdash;<br/>
Sooner shall this blue ocean melt to air,<br/>
    Sooner shall earth resolve itself to sea,<br/>
Than I resign thine image, oh, my fair!<br/>
    Or think of any thing excepting thee;<br/>
A mind diseased no remedy can physic<br/>
(Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick).<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Sooner shall heaven kiss earth (here he fell sicker),<br/>
    O, Julia! what is every other wo?<br/>
(For God&rsquo;s sake let me have a glass of liquor;<br/>
    Pedro, Battista, help me down below.)<br/>
Julia, my love! (you rascal, Pedro, quicker)&mdash;<br/>
    O, Julia! (this curst vessel pitches so)&mdash;<br/>
Beloved Julia, hear me still beseeching!&rsquo;<br/>
(Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)<br/>
<br/>
He felt that chilling heaviness of heart,<br/>
    Or rather stomach, which, alas! attends,<br/>
Beyond the best apothecary&rsquo;s art,<br/>
    The loss of love, the treachery of friends,<br/>
Or death of those we dote on, when a part<br/>
    Of us dies with them as each fond hope ends:<br/>
No doubt he would have been much more pathetic,<br/>
But the sea acted as a strong emetic.<br/>
<br/>
Love &rsquo;s a capricious power: I&rsquo;ve known it hold<br/>
    Out through a fever caused by its own heat,<br/>
But be much puzzled by a cough and cold,<br/>
    And find a quincy very hard to treat;<br/>
Against all noble maladies he &rsquo;s bold,<br/>
    But vulgar illnesses don&rsquo;t like to meet,<br/>
Nor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh,<br/>
Nor inflammations redden his blind eye.<br/>
<br/>
But worst of all is nausea, or a pain<br/>
    About the lower region of the bowels;<br/>
Love, who heroically breathes a vein,<br/>
    Shrinks from the application of hot towels,<br/>
And purgatives are dangerous to his reign,<br/>
    Sea-sickness death: his love was perfect, how else<br/>
Could Juan&rsquo;s passion, while the billows roar,<br/>
Resist his stomach, ne&rsquo;er at sea before?<br/>
<br/>
The ship, call&rsquo;d the most holy &lsquo;Trinidada,&rsquo;<br/>
    Was steering duly for the port Leghorn;<br/>
For there the Spanish family Moncada<br/>
    Were settled long ere Juan&rsquo;s sire was born:<br/>
They were relations, and for them he had a<br/>
    Letter of introduction, which the morn<br/>
Of his departure had been sent him by<br/>
His Spanish friends for those in Italy.<br/>
<br/>
His suite consisted of three servants and<br/>
    A tutor, the licentiate Pedrillo,<br/>
Who several languages did understand,<br/>
    But now lay sick and speechless on his pillow,<br/>
And rocking in his hammock, long&rsquo;d for land,<br/>
    His headache being increased by every billow;<br/>
And the waves oozing through the port-hole made<br/>
His berth a little damp, and him afraid.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Twas not without some reason, for the wind<br/>
    Increased at night, until it blew a gale;<br/>
And though &rsquo;twas not much to a naval mind,<br/>
    Some landsmen would have look&rsquo;d a little pale,<br/>
For sailors are, in fact, a different kind:<br/>
    At sunset they began to take in sail,<br/>
For the sky show&rsquo;d it would come on to blow,<br/>
And carry away, perhaps, a mast or so.<br/>
<br/>
At one o&rsquo;clock the wind with sudden shift<br/>
    Threw the ship right into the trough of the sea,<br/>
Which struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,<br/>
    Started the stern-post, also shatter&rsquo;d the<br/>
Whole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift<br/>
    Herself from out her present jeopardy,<br/>
The rudder tore away: &rsquo;twas time to sound<br/>
The pumps, and there were four feet water found.<br/>
<br/>
One gang of people instantly was put<br/>
    Upon the pumps and the remainder set<br/>
To get up part of the cargo, and what not;<br/>
    But they could not come at the leak as yet;<br/>
At last they did get at it really, but<br/>
    Still their salvation was an even bet:<br/>
The water rush&rsquo;d through in a way quite puzzling,<br/>
While they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,<br/>
<br/>
Into the opening; but all such ingredients<br/>
    Would have been vain, and they must have gone down,<br/>
Despite of all their efforts and expedients,<br/>
    But for the pumps: I&rsquo;m glad to make them known<br/>
To all the brother tars who may have need hence,<br/>
    For fifty tons of water were upthrown<br/>
By them per hour, and they had all been undone,<br/>
But for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.<br/>
<br/>
As day advanced the weather seem&rsquo;d to abate,<br/>
    And then the leak they reckon&rsquo;d to reduce,<br/>
And keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet<br/>
    Kept two hand and one chain-pump still in use.<br/>
The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late<br/>
    A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,<br/>
A gust&mdash;which all descriptive power transcends&mdash;<br/>
Laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.<br/>
<br/>
There she lay motionless, and seem&rsquo;d upset;<br/>
    The water left the hold, and wash&rsquo;d the decks,<br/>
And made a scene men do not soon forget;<br/>
    For they remember battles, fires, and wrecks,<br/>
Or any other thing that brings regret,<br/>
    Or breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:<br/>
Thus drownings are much talk&rsquo;d of by the divers,<br/>
And swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately the masts were cut away,<br/>
    Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,<br/>
The main-mast follow&rsquo;d: but the ship still lay<br/>
    Like a mere log, and baffled our intent.<br/>
Foremast and bowsprit were cut down, and they<br/>
    Eased her at last (although we never meant<br/>
To part with all till every hope was blighted),<br/>
And then with violence the old ship righted.<br/>
<br/>
It may be easily supposed, while this<br/>
    Was going on, some people were unquiet,<br/>
That passengers would find it much amiss<br/>
    To lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;<br/>
That even the able seaman, deeming his<br/>
    Days nearly o&rsquo;er, might be disposed to riot,<br/>
As upon such occasions tars will ask<br/>
For grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask.<br/>
<br/>
There&rsquo;s nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms<br/>
    As rum and true religion: thus it was,<br/>
Some plunder&rsquo;d, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,<br/>
    The high wind made the treble, and as bas<br/>
The hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms<br/>
    Of all the luckless landsmen&rsquo;s sea-sick maws:<br/>
Strange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,<br/>
Clamour&rsquo;d in chorus to the roaring ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps more mischief had been done, but for<br/>
    Our Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,<br/>
Got to the spirit-room, and stood before<br/>
    It with a pair of pistols; and their fears,<br/>
As if Death were more dreadful by his door<br/>
    Of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,<br/>
Kept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,<br/>
Thought it would be becoming to die drunk.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Give us more grog,&rsquo; they cried, &lsquo;for it will be<br/>
    All one an hour hence.&rsquo; Juan answer&rsquo;d, &lsquo;No!<br/>
&rsquo;Tis true that death awaits both you and me,<br/>
    But let us die like men, not sink below<br/>
Like brutes;&rsquo;&mdash;and thus his dangerous post kept he,<br/>
    And none liked to anticipate the blow;<br/>
And even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,<br/>
Was for some rum a disappointed suitor.<br/>
<br/>
The good old gentleman was quite aghast,<br/>
    And made a loud and pious lamentation;<br/>
Repented all his sins, and made a last<br/>
    Irrevocable vow of reformation;<br/>
Nothing should tempt him more (this peril past)<br/>
    To quit his academic occupation,<br/>
In cloisters of the classic Salamanca,<br/>
To follow Juan&rsquo;s wake, like Sancho Panca.<br/>
<br/>
But now there came a flash of hope once more;<br/>
    Day broke, and the wind lull&rsquo;d: the masts were gone,<br/>
The leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,<br/>
    The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.<br/>
They tried the pumps again, and though before<br/>
    Their desperate efforts seem&rsquo;d all useless grown,<br/>
A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale&mdash;<br/>
The stronger pump&rsquo;d, the weaker thrumm&rsquo;d a sail.<br/>
<br/>
Under the vessel&rsquo;s keel the sail was past,<br/>
    And for the moment it had some effect;<br/>
But with a leak, and not a stick of mast,<br/>
    Nor rag of canvas, what could they expect?<br/>
But still &rsquo;tis best to struggle to the last,<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis never too late to be wholly wreck&rsquo;d:<br/>
And though &rsquo;tis true that man can only die once,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.<br/>
<br/>
There winds and waves had hurl&rsquo;d them, and from thence,<br/>
    Without their will, they carried them away;<br/>
For they were forced with steering to dispense,<br/>
    And never had as yet a quiet day<br/>
On which they might repose, or even commence<br/>
    A jurymast or rudder, or could say<br/>
The ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,<br/>
Still swam&mdash;though not exactly like a duck.<br/>
<br/>
The wind, in fact, perhaps was rather less,<br/>
    But the ship labour&rsquo;d so, they scarce could hope<br/>
To weather out much longer; the distress<br/>
    Was also great with which they had to cope<br/>
For want of water, and their solid mess<br/>
    Was scant enough: in vain the telescope<br/>
Was used&mdash;nor sail nor shore appear&rsquo;d in sight,<br/>
Nought but the heavy sea, and coming night.<br/>
<br/>
Again the weather threaten&rsquo;d,&mdash;again blew<br/>
    A gale, and in the fore and after hold<br/>
Water appear&rsquo;d; yet, though the people knew<br/>
    All this, the most were patient, and some bold,<br/>
Until the chains and leathers were worn through<br/>
    Of all our pumps:&mdash;a wreck complete she roll&rsquo;d,<br/>
At mercy of the waves, whose mercies are<br/>
Like human beings during civil war.<br/>
<br/>
Then came the carpenter, at last, with tears<br/>
    In his rough eyes, and told the captain he<br/>
Could do no more: he was a man in years,<br/>
    And long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,<br/>
And if he wept at length, they were not fears<br/>
    That made his eyelids as a woman&rsquo;s be,<br/>
But he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,&mdash;<br/>
Two things for dying people quite bewildering.<br/>
<br/>
The ship was evidently settling now<br/>
    Fast by the head; and, all distinction gone,<br/>
Some went to prayers again, and made a vow<br/>
    Of candles to their saints&mdash;but there were none<br/>
To pay them with; and some look&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the bow;<br/>
    Some hoisted out the boats; and there was one<br/>
That begg&rsquo;d Pedrillo for an absolution,<br/>
Who told him to be damn&rsquo;d&mdash;in his confusion.<br/>
<br/>
Some lash&rsquo;d them in their hammocks; some put on<br/>
    Their best clothes, as if going to a fair;<br/>
Some cursed the day on which they saw the sun,<br/>
    And gnash&rsquo;d their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;<br/>
And others went on as they had begun,<br/>
    Getting the boats out, being well aware<br/>
That a tight boat will live in a rough sea,<br/>
Unless with breakers close beneath her lee.<br/>
<br/>
The worst of all was, that in their condition,<br/>
    Having been several days in great distress,<br/>
&rsquo;Twas difficult to get out such provision<br/>
    As now might render their long suffering less:<br/>
Men, even when dying, dislike inanition;<br/>
    Their stock was damaged by the weather&rsquo;s stress:<br/>
Two casks of biscuit and a keg of butter<br/>
Were all that could be thrown into the cutter.<br/>
<br/>
But in the long-boat they contrived to stow<br/>
    Some pounds of bread, though injured by the wet;<br/>
Water, a twenty-gallon cask or so;<br/>
    Six flasks of wine; and they contrived to get<br/>
A portion of their beef up from below,<br/>
    And with a piece of pork, moreover, met,<br/>
But scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon&mdash;<br/>
Then there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon.<br/>
<br/>
The other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had<br/>
    Been stove in the beginning of the gale;<br/>
And the long-boat&rsquo;s condition was but bad,<br/>
    As there were but two blankets for a sail,<br/>
And one oar for a mast, which a young lad<br/>
    Threw in by good luck over the ship&rsquo;s rail;<br/>
And two boats could not hold, far less be stored,<br/>
To save one half the people then on board.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Twas twilight, and the sunless day went down<br/>
    Over the waste of waters; like a veil,<br/>
Which, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown<br/>
    Of one whose hate is mask&rsquo;d but to assail,<br/>
Thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,<br/>
    And grimly darkled o&rsquo;er the faces pale,<br/>
And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear<br/>
Been their familiar, and now Death was here.<br/>
<br/>
Some trial had been making at a raft,<br/>
    With little hope in such a rolling sea,<br/>
A sort of thing at which one would have laugh&rsquo;d,<br/>
    If any laughter at such times could be,<br/>
Unless with people who too much have quaff&rsquo;d,<br/>
    And have a kind of wild and horrid glee,<br/>
Half epileptical and half hysterical:&mdash;<br/>
Their preservation would have been a miracle.<br/>
<br/>
At half-past eight o&rsquo;clock, booms, hencoops, spars,<br/>
    And all things, for a chance, had been cast loose,<br/>
That still could keep afloat the struggling tars,<br/>
    For yet they strove, although of no great use:<br/>
There was no light in heaven but a few stars,<br/>
    The boats put off o&rsquo;ercrowded with their crews;<br/>
She gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,<br/>
And, going down head foremost&mdash;sunk, in short.<br/>
<br/>
Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell&mdash;<br/>
    Then shriek&rsquo;d the timid, and stood still the brave,<br/>
Then some leap&rsquo;d overboard with dreadful yell,<br/>
    As eager to anticipate their grave;<br/>
And the sea yawn&rsquo;d around her like a hell,<br/>
    And down she suck&rsquo;d with her the whirling wave,<br/>
Like one who grapples with his enemy,<br/>
And strives to strangle him before he die.<br/>
<br/>
And first one universal shriek there rush&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Louder than the loud ocean, like a crash<br/>
Of echoing thunder; and then all was hush&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Save the wild wind and the remorseless dash<br/>
Of billows; but at intervals there gush&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Accompanied with a convulsive splash,<br/>
A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry<br/>
Of some strong swimmer in his agony.<br/>
<br/>
The boats, as stated, had got off before,<br/>
    And in them crowded several of the crew;<br/>
And yet their present hope was hardly more<br/>
    Than what it had been, for so strong it blew<br/>
There was slight chance of reaching any shore;<br/>
    And then they were too many, though so few&mdash;<br/>
Nine in the cutter, thirty in the boat,<br/>
Were counted in them when they got afloat.<br/>
<br/>
All the rest perish&rsquo;d; near two hundred souls<br/>
    Had left their bodies; and what &rsquo;s worse, alas!<br/>
When over Catholics the ocean rolls,<br/>
    They must wait several weeks before a mass<br/>
Takes off one peck of purgatorial coals,<br/>
    Because, till people know what &rsquo;s come to pass,<br/>
They won&rsquo;t lay out their money on the dead&mdash;<br/>
It costs three francs for every mass that &rsquo;s said.<br/>
<br/>
Juan got into the long-boat, and there<br/>
    Contrived to help Pedrillo to a place;<br/>
It seem&rsquo;d as if they had exchanged their care,<br/>
    For Juan wore the magisterial face<br/>
Which courage gives, while poor Pedrillo&rsquo;s pair<br/>
    Of eyes were crying for their owner&rsquo;s case:<br/>
Battista; though (a name call&rsquo;d shortly Tita),<br/>
Was lost by getting at some aqua-vita.<br/>
<br/>
Pedro, his valet, too, he tried to save,<br/>
    But the same cause, conducive to his loss,<br/>
Left him so drunk, he jump&rsquo;d into the wave<br/>
    As o&rsquo;er the cutter&rsquo;s edge he tried to cross,<br/>
And so he found a wine-and-watery grave;<br/>
    They could not rescue him although so close,<br/>
Because the sea ran higher every minute,<br/>
And for the boat&mdash;the crew kept crowding in it.<br/>
<br/>
A small old spaniel,&mdash;which had been Don Jose&rsquo;s,<br/>
    His father&rsquo;s, whom he loved, as ye may think,<br/>
For on such things the memory reposes<br/>
    With tenderness&mdash;stood howling on the brink,<br/>
Knowing (dogs have such intellectual noses!),<br/>
    No doubt, the vessel was about to sink;<br/>
And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepp&rsquo;d<br/>
Off, threw him in, then after him he leap&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
He also stuff&rsquo;d his money where he could<br/>
    About his person, and Pedrillo&rsquo;s too,<br/>
Who let him do, in fact, whate&rsquo;er he would,<br/>
    Not knowing what himself to say, or do,<br/>
As every rising wave his dread renew&rsquo;d;<br/>
    But Juan, trusting they might still get through,<br/>
And deeming there were remedies for any ill,<br/>
Thus re-embark&rsquo;d his tutor and his spaniel.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Twas a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,<br/>
    That the sail was becalm&rsquo;d between the seas,<br/>
Though on the wave&rsquo;s high top too much to set,<br/>
    They dared not take it in for all the breeze:<br/>
Each sea curl&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the stern, and kept them wet,<br/>
    And made them bale without a moment&rsquo;s ease,<br/>
So that themselves as well as hopes were damp&rsquo;d,<br/>
And the poor little cutter quickly swamp&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
Nine souls more went in her: the long-boat still<br/>
    Kept above water, with an oar for mast,<br/>
Two blankets stitch&rsquo;d together, answering ill<br/>
    Instead of sail, were to the oar made fast:<br/>
Though every wave roll&rsquo;d menacing to fill,<br/>
    And present peril all before surpass&rsquo;d,<br/>
They grieved for those who perish&rsquo;d with the cutter,<br/>
And also for the biscuit-casks and butter.<br/>
<br/>
The sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign<br/>
    Of the continuance of the gale: to run<br/>
Before the sea until it should grow fine,<br/>
    Was all that for the present could be done:<br/>
A few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine<br/>
    Were served out to the people, who begun<br/>
To faint, and damaged bread wet through the bags,<br/>
And most of them had little clothes but rags.<br/>
<br/>
They counted thirty, crowded in a space<br/>
    Which left scarce room for motion or exertion;<br/>
They did their best to modify their case,<br/>
    One half sate up, though numb&rsquo;d with the immersion,<br/>
While t&rsquo;other half were laid down in their place<br/>
    At watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian<br/>
Ague in its cold fit, they fill&rsquo;d their boat,<br/>
With nothing but the sky for a great coat.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis very certain the desire of life<br/>
    Prolongs it: this is obvious to physicians,<br/>
When patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,<br/>
    Survive through very desperate conditions,<br/>
Because they still can hope, nor shines the knife<br/>
    Nor shears of Atropos before their visions:<br/>
Despair of all recovery spoils longevity,<br/>
And makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis said that persons living on annuities<br/>
    Are longer lived than others,&mdash;God knows why,<br/>
Unless to plague the grantors,&mdash;yet so true it is,<br/>
    That some, I really think, do never die;<br/>
Of any creditors the worst a Jew it is,<br/>
    And that &rsquo;s their mode of furnishing supply:<br/>
In my young days they lent me cash that way,<br/>
Which I found very troublesome to pay.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis thus with people in an open boat,<br/>
    They live upon the love of life, and bear<br/>
More than can be believed, or even thought,<br/>
    And stand like rocks the tempest&rsquo;s wear and tear;<br/>
And hardship still has been the sailor&rsquo;s lot,<br/>
    Since Noah&rsquo;s ark went cruising here and there;<br/>
She had a curious crew as well as cargo,<br/>
Like the first old Greek privateer, the Argo.<br/>
<br/>
But man is a carnivorous production,<br/>
    And must have meals, at least one meal a day;<br/>
He cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,<br/>
    But, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;<br/>
Although his anatomical construction<br/>
    Bears vegetables, in a grumbling way,<br/>
Your labouring people think beyond all question,<br/>
Beef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion.<br/>
<br/>
And thus it was with this our hapless crew;<br/>
    For on the third day there came on a calm,<br/>
And though at first their strength it might renew,<br/>
    And lying on their weariness like balm,<br/>
Lull&rsquo;d them like turtles sleeping on the blue<br/>
    Of ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,<br/>
And fell all ravenously on their provision,<br/>
Instead of hoarding it with due precision.<br/>
<br/>
The consequence was easily foreseen&mdash;<br/>
    They ate up all they had, and drank their wine,<br/>
In spite of all remonstrances, and then<br/>
    On what, in fact, next day were they to dine?<br/>
They hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!<br/>
    And carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,<br/>
But as they had but one oar, and that brittle,<br/>
It would have been more wise to save their victual.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth day came, but not a breath of air,<br/>
    And Ocean slumber&rsquo;d like an unwean&rsquo;d child:<br/>
The fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,<br/>
    The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild&mdash;<br/>
With their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)<br/>
    What could they do? and hunger&rsquo;s rage grew wild:<br/>
So Juan&rsquo;s spaniel, spite of his entreating,<br/>
Was kill&rsquo;d and portion&rsquo;d out for present eating.<br/>
<br/>
On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,<br/>
    And Juan, who had still refused, because<br/>
The creature was his father&rsquo;s dog that died,<br/>
    Now feeling all the vulture in his jaws,<br/>
With some remorse received (though first denied)<br/>
    As a great favour one of the fore-paws,<br/>
Which he divided with Pedrillo, who<br/>
Devour&rsquo;d it, longing for the other too.<br/>
<br/>
The seventh day, and no wind&mdash;the burning sun<br/>
    Blister&rsquo;d and scorch&rsquo;d, and, stagnant on the sea,<br/>
They lay like carcasses; and hope was none,<br/>
    Save in the breeze that came not; savagely<br/>
They glared upon each other&mdash;all was done,<br/>
    Water, and wine, and food,&mdash;and you might see<br/>
The longings of the cannibal arise<br/>
(Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes.<br/>
<br/>
At length one whisper&rsquo;d his companion, who<br/>
    Whisper&rsquo;d another, and thus it went round,<br/>
And then into a hoarser murmur grew,<br/>
    An ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;<br/>
And when his comrade&rsquo;s thought each sufferer knew,<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas but his own, suppress&rsquo;d till now, he found:<br/>
And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,<br/>
And who should die to be his fellow&rsquo;s food.<br/>
<br/>
But ere they came to this, they that day shared<br/>
    Some leathern caps, and what remain&rsquo;d of shoes;<br/>
And then they look&rsquo;d around them and despair&rsquo;d,<br/>
    And none to be the sacrifice would choose;<br/>
At length the lots were torn up, and prepared,<br/>
    But of materials that much shock the Muse&mdash;<br/>
Having no paper, for the want of better,<br/>
They took by force from Juan Julia&rsquo;s letter.<br/>
<br/>
The lots were made, and mark&rsquo;d, and mix&rsquo;d, and handed,<br/>
    In silent horror, and their distribution<br/>
Lull&rsquo;d even the savage hunger which demanded,<br/>
    Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution;<br/>
None in particular had sought or plann&rsquo;d it,<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas nature gnaw&rsquo;d them to this resolution,<br/>
By which none were permitted to be neuter&mdash;<br/>
And the lot fell on Juan&rsquo;s luckless tutor.<br/>
<br/>
He but requested to be bled to death:<br/>
    The surgeon had his instruments, and bled<br/>
Pedrillo, and so gently ebb&rsquo;d his breath,<br/>
    You hardly could perceive when he was dead.<br/>
He died as born, a Catholic in faith,<br/>
    Like most in the belief in which they&rsquo;re bred,<br/>
And first a little crucifix he kiss&rsquo;d,<br/>
And then held out his jugular and wrist.<br/>
<br/>
The surgeon, as there was no other fee,<br/>
    Had his first choice of morsels for his pains;<br/>
But being thirstiest at the moment, he<br/>
    Preferr&rsquo;d a draught from the fast-flowing veins:<br/>
Part was divided, part thrown in the sea,<br/>
    And such things as the entrails and the brains<br/>
Regaled two sharks, who follow&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the billow&mdash;<br/>
The sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo.<br/>
<br/>
The sailors ate him, all save three or four,<br/>
    Who were not quite so fond of animal food;<br/>
To these was added Juan, who, before<br/>
    Refusing his own spaniel, hardly could<br/>
Feel now his appetite increased much more;<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas not to be expected that he should,<br/>
Even in extremity of their disaster,<br/>
Dine with them on his pastor and his master.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Twas better that he did not; for, in fact,<br/>
    The consequence was awful in the extreme;<br/>
For they, who were most ravenous in the act,<br/>
    Went raging mad&mdash;Lord! how they did blaspheme!<br/>
And foam and roll, with strange convulsions rack&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Drinking salt water like a mountain-stream,<br/>
Tearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,<br/>
And, with hyaena-laughter, died despairing.<br/>
<br/>
Their numbers were much thinn&rsquo;d by this infliction,<br/>
    And all the rest were thin enough, Heaven knows;<br/>
And some of them had lost their recollection,<br/>
    Happier than they who still perceived their woes;<br/>
But others ponder&rsquo;d on a new dissection,<br/>
    As if not warn&rsquo;d sufficiently by those<br/>
Who had already perish&rsquo;d, suffering madly,<br/>
For having used their appetites so sadly.<br/>
<br/>
And next they thought upon the master&rsquo;s mate,<br/>
    As fattest; but he saved himself, because,<br/>
Besides being much averse from such a fate,<br/>
    There were some other reasons: the first was,<br/>
He had been rather indisposed of late;<br/>
    And that which chiefly proved his saving clause<br/>
Was a small present made to him at Cadiz,<br/>
By general subscription of the ladies.<br/>
<br/>
Of poor Pedrillo something still remain&rsquo;d,<br/>
    But was used sparingly,&mdash;some were afraid,<br/>
And others still their appetites constrain&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Or but at times a little supper made;<br/>
All except Juan, who throughout abstain&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Chewing a piece of bamboo and some lead:<br/>
At length they caught two boobies and a noddy,<br/>
And then they left off eating the dead body.<br/>
<br/>
And if Pedrillo&rsquo;s fate should shocking be,<br/>
    Remember Ugolino condescends<br/>
To eat the head of his arch-enemy<br/>
    The moment after he politely ends<br/>
His tale: if foes be food in hell, at sea<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis surely fair to dine upon our friends,<br/>
When shipwreck&rsquo;s short allowance grows too scanty,<br/>
Without being much more horrible than Dante.<br/>
<br/>
And the same night there fell a shower of rain,<br/>
    For which their mouths gaped, like the cracks of earth<br/>
When dried to summer dust; till taught by pain<br/>
    Men really know not what good water &rsquo;s worth;<br/>
If you had been in Turkey or in Spain,<br/>
    Or with a famish&rsquo;d boat&rsquo;s-crew had your berth,<br/>
Or in the desert heard the camel&rsquo;s bell,<br/>
You&rsquo;d wish yourself where Truth is&mdash;in a well.<br/>
<br/>
It pour&rsquo;d down torrents, but they were no richer<br/>
    Until they found a ragged piece of sheet,<br/>
Which served them as a sort of spongy pitcher,<br/>
    And when they deem&rsquo;d its moisture was complete<br/>
They wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher<br/>
    Might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet<br/>
As a full pot of porter, to their thinking<br/>
They ne&rsquo;er till now had known the joys of drinking.<br/>
<br/>
And their baked lips, with many a bloody crack,<br/>
    Suck&rsquo;d in the moisture, which like nectar stream&rsquo;d;<br/>
Their throats were ovens, their swoln tongues were black,<br/>
    As the rich man&rsquo;s in hell, who vainly scream&rsquo;d<br/>
To beg the beggar, who could not rain back<br/>
    A drop of dew, when every drop had seem&rsquo;d<br/>
To taste of heaven&mdash;If this be true, indeed<br/>
Some Christians have a comfortable creed.<br/>
<br/>
There were two fathers in this ghastly crew,<br/>
    And with them their two sons, of whom the one<br/>
Was more robust and hardy to the view,<br/>
    But he died early; and when he was gone,<br/>
His nearest messmate told his sire, who threw<br/>
    One glance at him, and said, &lsquo;Heaven&rsquo;s will be done!<br/>
I can do nothing,&rsquo; and he saw him thrown<br/>
Into the deep without a tear or groan.<br/>
<br/>
The other father had a weaklier child,<br/>
    Of a soft cheek and aspect delicate;<br/>
But the boy bore up long, and with a mild<br/>
    And patient spirit held aloof his fate;<br/>
Little he said, and now and then he smiled,<br/>
    As if to win a part from off the weight<br/>
He saw increasing on his father&rsquo;s heart,<br/>
With the deep deadly thought that they must part.<br/>
<br/>
And o&rsquo;er him bent his sire, and never raised<br/>
    His eyes from off his face, but wiped the foam<br/>
From his pale lips, and ever on him gazed,<br/>
    And when the wish&rsquo;d-for shower at length was come,<br/>
And the boy&rsquo;s eyes, which the dull film half glazed,<br/>
    Brighten&rsquo;d, and for a moment seem&rsquo;d to roam,<br/>
He squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain<br/>
Into his dying child&rsquo;s mouth&mdash;but in vain.<br/>
<br/>
The boy expired&mdash;the father held the clay,<br/>
    And look&rsquo;d upon it long, and when at last<br/>
Death left no doubt, and the dead burthen lay<br/>
    Stiff on his heart, and pulse and hope were past,<br/>
He watch&rsquo;d it wistfully, until away<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas borne by the rude wave wherein &rsquo;twas cast;<br/>
Then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering,<br/>
And gave no sign of life, save his limbs quivering.<br/>
<br/>
Now overhead a rainbow, bursting through<br/>
    The scattering clouds, shone, spanning the dark sea,<br/>
Resting its bright base on the quivering blue;<br/>
    And all within its arch appear&rsquo;d to be<br/>
Clearer than that without, and its wide hue<br/>
    Wax&rsquo;d broad and waving, like a banner free,<br/>
Then changed like to a bow that &rsquo;s bent, and then<br/>
Forsook the dim eyes of these shipwreck&rsquo;d men.<br/>
<br/>
It changed, of course; a heavenly chameleon,<br/>
    The airy child of vapour and the sun,<br/>
Brought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,<br/>
    Baptized in molten gold, and swathed in dun,<br/>
Glittering like crescents o&rsquo;er a Turk&rsquo;s pavilion,<br/>
    And blending every colour into one,<br/>
Just like a black eye in a recent scuffle<br/>
(For sometimes we must box without the muffle).<br/>
<br/>
Our shipwreck&rsquo;d seamen thought it a good omen&mdash;<br/>
    It is as well to think so, now and then;<br/>
&rsquo;Twas an old custom of the Greek and Roman,<br/>
    And may become of great advantage when<br/>
Folks are discouraged; and most surely no men<br/>
    Had greater need to nerve themselves again<br/>
Than these, and so this rainbow look&rsquo;d like hope&mdash;<br/>
Quite a celestial kaleidoscope.<br/>
<br/>
About this time a beautiful white bird,<br/>
    Webfooted, not unlike a dove in size<br/>
And plumage (probably it might have err&rsquo;d<br/>
    Upon its course), pass&rsquo;d oft before their eyes,<br/>
And tried to perch, although it saw and heard<br/>
    The men within the boat, and in this guise<br/>
It came and went, and flutter&rsquo;d round them till<br/>
Night fell: this seem&rsquo;d a better omen still.<br/>
<br/>
But in this case I also must remark,<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas well this bird of promise did not perch,<br/>
Because the tackle of our shatter&rsquo;d bark<br/>
    Was not so safe for roosting as a church;<br/>
And had it been the dove from Noah&rsquo;s ark,<br/>
    Returning there from her successful search,<br/>
Which in their way that moment chanced to fall,<br/>
They would have eat her, olive-branch and all.<br/>
<br/>
With twilight it again came on to blow,<br/>
    But not with violence; the stars shone out,<br/>
The boat made way; yet now they were so low,<br/>
    They knew not where nor what they were about;<br/>
Some fancied they saw land, and some said &lsquo;No!&rsquo;<br/>
    The frequent fog-banks gave them cause to doubt&mdash;<br/>
Some swore that they heard breakers, others guns,<br/>
And all mistook about the latter once.<br/>
<br/>
As morning broke, the light wind died away,<br/>
    When he who had the watch sung out and swore,<br/>
If &rsquo;twas not land that rose with the sun&rsquo;s ray,<br/>
    He wish&rsquo;d that land he never might see more;<br/>
And the rest rubb&rsquo;d their eyes and saw a bay,<br/>
    Or thought they saw, and shaped their course for shore;<br/>
For shore it was, and gradually grew<br/>
Distinct, and high, and palpable to view.<br/>
<br/>
And then of these some part burst into tears,<br/>
    And others, looking with a stupid stare,<br/>
Could not yet separate their hopes from fears,<br/>
    And seem&rsquo;d as if they had no further care;<br/>
While a few pray&rsquo;d (the first time for some years)&mdash;<br/>
    And at the bottom of the boat three were<br/>
Asleep: they shook them by the hand and head,<br/>
And tried to awaken them, but found them dead.<br/>
<br/>
The day before, fast sleeping on the water,<br/>
    They found a turtle of the hawk&rsquo;s-bill kind,<br/>
And by good fortune, gliding softly, caught her,<br/>
    Which yielded a day&rsquo;s life, and to their mind<br/>
Proved even still a more nutritious matter,<br/>
    Because it left encouragement behind:<br/>
They thought that in such perils, more than chance<br/>
Had sent them this for their deliverance.<br/>
<br/>
The land appear&rsquo;d a high and rocky coast,<br/>
    And higher grew the mountains as they drew,<br/>
Set by a current, toward it: they were lost<br/>
    In various conjectures, for none knew<br/>
To what part of the earth they had been tost,<br/>
    So changeable had been the winds that blew;<br/>
Some thought it was Mount AEtna, some the highlands,<br/>
Of Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, or other islands.<br/>
<br/>
Meantime the current, with a rising gale,<br/>
    Still set them onwards to the welcome shore,<br/>
Like Charon&rsquo;s bark of spectres, dull and pale:<br/>
    Their living freight was now reduced to four,<br/>
And three dead, whom their strength could not avail<br/>
    To heave into the deep with those before,<br/>
Though the two sharks still follow&rsquo;d them, and dash&rsquo;d<br/>
The spray into their faces as they splash&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
Famine, despair, cold, thirst, and heat, had done<br/>
    Their work on them by turns, and thinn&rsquo;d them to<br/>
Such things a mother had not known her son<br/>
    Amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew;<br/>
By night chill&rsquo;d, by day scorch&rsquo;d, thus one by one<br/>
    They perish&rsquo;d, until wither&rsquo;d to these few,<br/>
But chiefly by a species of self-slaughter,<br/>
In washing down Pedrillo with salt water.<br/>
<br/>
As they drew nigh the land, which now was seen<br/>
    Unequal in its aspect here and there,<br/>
They felt the freshness of its growing green,<br/>
    That waved in forest-tops, and smooth&rsquo;d the air,<br/>
And fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen<br/>
    From glistening waves, and skies so hot and bare&mdash;<br/>
Lovely seem&rsquo;d any object that should sweep<br/>
Away the vast, salt, dread, eternal deep.<br/>
<br/>
The shore look&rsquo;d wild, without a trace of man,<br/>
    And girt by formidable waves; but they<br/>
Were mad for land, and thus their course they ran,<br/>
    Though right ahead the roaring breakers lay:<br/>
A reef between them also now began<br/>
    To show its boiling surf and bounding spray,<br/>
But finding no place for their landing better,<br/>
They ran the boat for shore,&mdash;and overset her.<br/>
<br/>
But in his native stream, the Guadalquivir,<br/>
    Juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont;<br/>
And having learnt to swim in that sweet river,<br/>
    Had often turn&rsquo;d the art to some account:<br/>
A better swimmer you could scarce see ever,<br/>
    He could, perhaps, have pass&rsquo;d the Hellespont,<br/>
As once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)<br/>
Leander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did.<br/>
<br/>
So here, though faint, emaciated, and stark,<br/>
    He buoy&rsquo;d his boyish limbs, and strove to ply<br/>
With the quick wave, and gain, ere it was dark,<br/>
    The beach which lay before him, high and dry:<br/>
The greatest danger here was from a shark,<br/>
    That carried off his neighbour by the thigh;<br/>
As for the other two, they could not swim,<br/>
So nobody arrived on shore but him.<br/>
<br/>
Nor yet had he arrived but for the oar,<br/>
    Which, providentially for him, was wash&rsquo;d<br/>
Just as his feeble arms could strike no more,<br/>
    And the hard wave o&rsquo;erwhelm&rsquo;d him as &rsquo;twas dash&rsquo;d<br/>
Within his grasp; he clung to it, and sore<br/>
    The waters beat while he thereto was lash&rsquo;d;<br/>
At last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he<br/>
Roll&rsquo;d on the beach, half-senseless, from the sea:<br/>
<br/>
There, breathless, with his digging nails he clung<br/>
    Fast to the sand, lest the returning wave,<br/>
From whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,<br/>
    Should suck him back to her insatiate grave:<br/>
And there he lay, full length, where he was flung,<br/>
    Before the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,<br/>
With just enough of life to feel its pain,<br/>
And deem that it was saved, perhaps in vain.<br/>
<br/>
With slow and staggering effort he arose,<br/>
    But sunk again upon his bleeding knee<br/>
And quivering hand; and then he look&rsquo;d for those<br/>
    Who long had been his mates upon the sea;<br/>
But none of them appear&rsquo;d to share his woes,<br/>
    Save one, a corpse, from out the famish&rsquo;d three,<br/>
Who died two days before, and now had found<br/>
An unknown barren beach for burial ground.<br/>
<br/>
And as he gazed, his dizzy brain spun fast,<br/>
    And down he sunk; and as he sunk, the sand<br/>
Swam round and round, and all his senses pass&rsquo;d:<br/>
    He fell upon his side, and his stretch&rsquo;d hand<br/>
Droop&rsquo;d dripping on the oar (their jurymast),<br/>
    And, like a wither&rsquo;d lily, on the land<br/>
His slender frame and pallid aspect lay,<br/>
As fair a thing as e&rsquo;er was form&rsquo;d of clay.<br/>
<br/>
How long in his damp trance young Juan lay<br/>
    He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,<br/>
And Time had nothing more of night nor day<br/>
    For his congealing blood, and senses dim;<br/>
And how this heavy faintness pass&rsquo;d away<br/>
    He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,<br/>
And tingling vein, seem&rsquo;d throbbing back to life,<br/>
For Death, though vanquish&rsquo;d, still retired with strife.<br/>
<br/>
His eyes he open&rsquo;d, shut, again unclosed,<br/>
    For all was doubt and dizziness; he thought<br/>
He still was in the boat and had but dozed,<br/>
    And felt again with his despair o&rsquo;erwrought,<br/>
And wish&rsquo;d it death in which he had reposed;<br/>
    And then once more his feelings back were brought,<br/>
And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen<br/>
A lovely female face of seventeen.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Twas bending dose o&rsquo;er his, and the small mouth<br/>
    Seem&rsquo;d almost prying into his for breath;<br/>
And chafing him, the soft warm hand of youth<br/>
    Recall&rsquo;d his answering spirits back from death;<br/>
And, bathing his chill temples, tried to soothe<br/>
    Each pulse to animation, till beneath<br/>
Its gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh<br/>
To these kind efforts made a low reply.<br/>
<br/>
Then was the cordial pour&rsquo;d, and mantle flung<br/>
    Around his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm<br/>
Raised higher the faint head which o&rsquo;er it hung;<br/>
    And her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,<br/>
Pillow&rsquo;d his death-like forehead; then she wrung<br/>
    His dewy curls, long drench&rsquo;d by every storm;<br/>
And watch&rsquo;d with eagerness each throb that drew<br/>
A sigh from his heaved bosom&mdash;and hers, too.<br/>
<br/>
And lifting him with care into the cave,<br/>
    The gentle girl and her attendant,&mdash;one<br/>
Young, yet her elder, and of brow less grave,<br/>
    And more robust of figure,&mdash;then begun<br/>
To kindle fire, and as the new flames gave<br/>
    Light to the rocks that roof&rsquo;d them, which the sun<br/>
Had never seen, the maid, or whatsoe&rsquo;er<br/>
She was, appear&rsquo;d distinct, and tall, and fair.<br/>
<br/>
Her brow was overhung with coins of gold,<br/>
    That sparkled o&rsquo;er the auburn of her hair&mdash;<br/>
Her clustering hair, whose longer locks were roll&rsquo;d<br/>
    In braids behind; and though her stature were<br/>
Even of the highest for a female mould,<br/>
    They nearly reach&rsquo;d her heel; and in her air<br/>
There was a something which bespoke command,<br/>
As one who was a lady in the land.<br/>
<br/>
Her hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes<br/>
    Were black as death, their lashes the same hue,<br/>
Of downcast length, in whose silk shadow lies<br/>
    Deepest attraction; for when to the view<br/>
Forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies,<br/>
    Ne&rsquo;er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis as the snake late coil&rsquo;d, who pours his length,<br/>
And hurls at once his venom and his strength.<br/>
<br/>
Her brow was white and low, her cheek&rsquo;s pure dye<br/>
    Like twilight rosy still with the set sun;<br/>
Short upper lip&mdash;sweet lips! that make us sigh<br/>
    Ever to have seen such; for she was one<br/>
Fit for the model of a statuary<br/>
    (A race of mere impostors, when all &rsquo;s done&mdash;<br/>
I&rsquo;ve seen much finer women, ripe and real,<br/>
Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal).<br/>
<br/>
I&rsquo;ll tell you why I say so, for &rsquo;tis just<br/>
    One should not rail without a decent cause:<br/>
There was an Irish lady, to whose bust<br/>
    I ne&rsquo;er saw justice done, and yet she was<br/>
A frequent model; and if e&rsquo;er she must<br/>
    Yield to stern Time and Nature&rsquo;s wrinkling laws,<br/>
They will destroy a face which mortal thought<br/>
Ne&rsquo;er compass&rsquo;d, nor less mortal chisel wrought.<br/>
<br/>
And such was she, the lady of the cave:<br/>
    Her dress was very different from the Spanish,<br/>
Simpler, and yet of colours not so grave;<br/>
    For, as you know, the Spanish women banish<br/>
Bright hues when out of doors, and yet, while wave<br/>
    Around them (what I hope will never vanish)<br/>
The basquina and the mantilla, they<br/>
Seem at the same time mystical and gay.<br/>
<br/>
But with our damsel this was not the case:<br/>
    Her dress was many-colour&rsquo;d, finely spun;<br/>
Her locks curl&rsquo;d negligently round her face,<br/>
    But through them gold and gems profusely shone:<br/>
Her girdle sparkled, and the richest lace<br/>
    Flow&rsquo;d in her veil, and many a precious stone<br/>
Flash&rsquo;d on her little hand; but, what was shocking,<br/>
Her small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking.<br/>
<br/>
The other female&rsquo;s dress was not unlike,<br/>
    But of inferior materials: she<br/>
Had not so many ornaments to strike,<br/>
    Her hair had silver only, bound to be<br/>
Her dowry; and her veil, in form alike,<br/>
    Was coarser; and her air, though firm, less free;<br/>
Her hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes<br/>
As black, but quicker, and of smaller size.<br/>
<br/>
And these two tended him, and cheer&rsquo;d him both<br/>
    With food and raiment, and those soft attentions,<br/>
Which are (as I must own) of female growth,<br/>
    And have ten thousand delicate inventions:<br/>
They made a most superior mess of broth,<br/>
    A thing which poesy but seldom mentions,<br/>
But the best dish that e&rsquo;er was cook&rsquo;d since Homer&rsquo;s<br/>
Achilles ordered dinner for new comers.<br/>
<br/>
I&rsquo;ll tell you who they were, this female pair,<br/>
    Lest they should seem princesses in disguise;<br/>
Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air<br/>
    Of clap-trap which your recent poets prize;<br/>
And so, in short, the girls they really were<br/>
    They shall appear before your curious eyes,<br/>
Mistress and maid; the first was only daughter<br/>
Of an old man who lived upon the water.<br/>
<br/>
A fisherman he had been in his youth,<br/>
    And still a sort of fisherman was he;<br/>
But other speculations were, in sooth,<br/>
    Added to his connection with the sea,<br/>
Perhaps not so respectable, in truth:<br/>
    A little smuggling, and some piracy,<br/>
Left him, at last, the sole of many masters<br/>
Of an ill-gotten million of piastres.<br/>
<br/>
A fisher, therefore, was he,&mdash;though of men,<br/>
    Like Peter the Apostle,&mdash;and he fish&rsquo;d<br/>
For wandering merchant-vessels, now and then,<br/>
    And sometimes caught as many as he wish&rsquo;d;<br/>
The cargoes he confiscated, and gain<br/>
    He sought in the slave-market too, and dish&rsquo;d<br/>
Full many a morsel for that Turkish trade,<br/>
By which, no doubt, a good deal may be made.<br/>
<br/>
He was a Greek, and on his isle had built<br/>
    (One of the wild and smaller Cyclades)<br/>
A very handsome house from out his guilt,<br/>
    And there he lived exceedingly at ease;<br/>
Heaven knows what cash he got or blood he spilt,<br/>
    A sad old fellow was he, if you please;<br/>
But this I know, it was a spacious building,<br/>
Full of barbaric carving, paint, and gilding.<br/>
<br/>
He had an only daughter, call&rsquo;d Haidee,<br/>
    The greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;<br/>
Besides, so very beautiful was she,<br/>
    Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles:<br/>
Still in her teens, and like a lovely tree<br/>
    She grew to womanhood, and between whiles<br/>
Rejected several suitors, just to learn<br/>
How to accept a better in his turn.<br/>

<p class="noindent">
And walking out upon the beach, below<br/>
    The cliff, towards sunset, on that day she found,<br/>
Insensible,&mdash;not dead, but nearly so,&mdash;<br/>
    Don Juan, almost famish&rsquo;d, and half drown&rsquo;d;<br/>
But being naked, she was shock&rsquo;d, you know,<br/>
    Yet deem&rsquo;d herself in common pity bound,<br/>
As far as in her lay, &lsquo;to take him in,<br/>
A stranger&rsquo; dying, with so white a skin.<br/>
<br/>
But taking him into her father&rsquo;s house<br/>
    Was not exactly the best way to save,<br/>
But like conveying to the cat the mouse,<br/>
    Or people in a trance into their grave;<br/>
Because the good old man had so much &lsquo;nous,&rsquo;<br/>
    Unlike the honest Arab thieves so brave,<br/>
He would have hospitably cured the stranger,<br/>
And sold him instantly when out of danger.<br/>
<br/>
And therefore, with her maid, she thought it best<br/>
    (A virgin always on her maid relies)<br/>
To place him in the cave for present rest:<br/>
    And when, at last, he open&rsquo;d his black eyes,<br/>
Their charity increased about their guest;<br/>
    And their compassion grew to such a size,<br/>
It open&rsquo;d half the turnpike-gates to heaven<br/>
(St. Paul says, &rsquo;tis the toll which must be given).<br/>
<br/>
They made a fire,&mdash;but such a fire as they<br/>
    Upon the moment could contrive with such<br/>
Materials as were cast up round the bay,&mdash;<br/>
    Some broken planks, and oars, that to the touch<br/>
Were nearly tinder, since so long they lay<br/>
    A mast was almost crumbled to a crutch;<br/>
But, by God&rsquo;s grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,<br/>
That there was fuel to have furnish&rsquo;d twenty.<br/>
<br/>
He had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,<br/>
    For Haidee stripped her sables off to make<br/>
His couch; and, that he might be more at ease,<br/>
    And warm, in case by chance he should awake,<br/>
They also gave a petticoat apiece,<br/>
    She and her maid&mdash;and promised by daybreak<br/>
To pay him a fresh visit, with a dish<br/>
For breakfast, of eggs, coffee, bread, and fish.<br/>
<br/>
And thus they left him to his lone repose:<br/>
    Juan slept like a top, or like the dead,<br/>
Who sleep at last, perhaps (God only knows),<br/>
    Just for the present; and in his lull&rsquo;d head<br/>
Not even a vision of his former woes<br/>
    Throbb&rsquo;d in accursed dreams, which sometimes spread<br/>
Unwelcome visions of our former years,<br/>
Till the eye, cheated, opens thick with tears.<br/>
<br/>
Young Juan slept all dreamless:&mdash;but the maid,<br/>
    Who smooth&rsquo;d his pillow, as she left the den<br/>
Look&rsquo;d back upon him, and a moment stay&rsquo;d,<br/>
    And turn&rsquo;d, believing that he call&rsquo;d again.<br/>
He slumber&rsquo;d; yet she thought, at least she said<br/>
    (The heart will slip, even as the tongue and pen),<br/>
He had pronounced her name&mdash;but she forgot<br/>
That at this moment Juan knew it not.<br/>
<br/>
And pensive to her father&rsquo;s house she went,<br/>
    Enjoining silence strict to Zoe, who<br/>
Better than her knew what, in fact, she meant,<br/>
    She being wiser by a year or two:<br/>
A year or two &rsquo;s an age when rightly spent,<br/>
    And Zoe spent hers, as most women do,<br/>
In gaining all that useful sort of knowledge<br/>
Which is acquired in Nature&rsquo;s good old college.<br/>
<br/>
The morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still<br/>
    Fast in his cave, and nothing clash&rsquo;d upon<br/>
His rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,<br/>
    And the young beams of the excluded sun,<br/>
Troubled him not, and he might sleep his fill;<br/>
    And need he had of slumber yet, for none<br/>
Had suffer&rsquo;d more&mdash;his hardships were comparative<br/>
To those related in my grand-dad&rsquo;s &lsquo;Narrative.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Not so Haidee: she sadly toss&rsquo;d and tumbled,<br/>
    And started from her sleep, and, turning o&rsquo;er<br/>
Dream&rsquo;d of a thousand wrecks, o&rsquo;er which she stumbled,<br/>
    And handsome corpses strew&rsquo;d upon the shore;<br/>
And woke her maid so early that she grumbled,<br/>
    And call&rsquo;d her father&rsquo;s old slaves up, who swore<br/>
In several oaths&mdash;Armenian, Turk, and Greek&mdash;<br/>
They knew not what to think of such a freak.<br/>
<br/>
But up she got, and up she made them get,<br/>
    With some pretence about the sun, that makes<br/>
Sweet skies just when he rises, or is set;<br/>
    And &rsquo;tis, no doubt, a sight to see when breaks<br/>
Bright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet<br/>
    With mist, and every bird with him awakes,<br/>
And night is flung off like a mourning suit<br/>
Worn for a husband,&mdash;or some other brute.<br/>
<br/>
I say, the sun is a most glorious sight,<br/>
    I&rsquo;ve seen him rise full oft, indeed of late<br/>
I have sat up on purpose all the night,<br/>
    Which hastens, as physicians say, one&rsquo;s fate;<br/>
And so all ye, who would be in the right<br/>
    In health and purse, begin your day to date<br/>
From daybreak, and when coffin&rsquo;d at fourscore,<br/>
Engrave upon the plate, you rose at four.<br/>
<br/>
And Haidee met the morning face to face;<br/>
    Her own was freshest, though a feverish flush<br/>
Had dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race<br/>
    From heart to cheek is curb&rsquo;d into a blush,<br/>
Like to a torrent which a mountain&rsquo;s base,<br/>
    That overpowers some Alpine river&rsquo;s rush,<br/>
Checks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread;<br/>
Or the Red Sea&mdash;but the sea is not red.<br/>
<br/>
And down the cliff the island virgin came,<br/>
    And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,<br/>
While the sun smiled on her with his first flame,<br/>
    And young Aurora kiss&rsquo;d her lips with dew,<br/>
Taking her for a sister; just the same<br/>
    Mistake you would have made on seeing the two,<br/>
Although the mortal, quite as fresh and fair,<br/>
Had all the advantage, too, of not being air.<br/>
<br/>
And when into the cavern Haidee stepp&rsquo;d<br/>
    All timidly, yet rapidly, she saw<br/>
That like an infant Juan sweetly slept;<br/>
    And then she stopp&rsquo;d, and stood as if in awe<br/>
(For sleep is awful), and on tiptoe crept<br/>
    And wrapt him closer, lest the air, too raw,<br/>
Should reach his blood, then o&rsquo;er him still as death<br/>
Bent with hush&rsquo;d lips, that drank his scarce-drawn breath.<br/>
<br/>
And thus like to an angel o&rsquo;er the dying<br/>
    Who die in righteousness, she lean&rsquo;d; and there<br/>
All tranquilly the shipwreck&rsquo;d boy was lying,<br/>
    As o&rsquo;er him the calm and stirless air:<br/>
But Zoe the meantime some eggs was frying,<br/>
    Since, after all, no doubt the youthful pair<br/>
Must breakfast&mdash;and betimes, lest they should ask it,<br/>
She drew out her provision from the basket.<br/>
<br/>
She knew that the best feelings must have victual,<br/>
    And that a shipwreck&rsquo;d youth would hungry be;<br/>
Besides, being less in love, she yawn&rsquo;d a little,<br/>
    And felt her veins chill&rsquo;d by the neighbouring sea;<br/>
And so, she cook&rsquo;d their breakfast to a tittle;<br/>
    I can&rsquo;t say that she gave them any tea,<br/>
But there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,<br/>
With Scio wine,&mdash;and all for love, not money.<br/>
<br/>
And Zoe, when the eggs were ready, and<br/>
    The coffee made, would fain have waken&rsquo;d Juan;<br/>
But Haidee stopp&rsquo;d her with her quick small hand,<br/>
    And without word, a sign her finger drew on<br/>
Her lip, which Zoe needs must understand;<br/>
    And, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,<br/>
Because her mistress would not let her break<br/>
That sleep which seem&rsquo;d as it would ne&rsquo;er awake.<br/>
<br/>
For still he lay, and on his thin worn cheek<br/>
    A purple hectic play&rsquo;d like dying day<br/>
On the snow-tops of distant hills; the streak<br/>
    Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,<br/>
Where the blue veins look&rsquo;d shadowy, shrunk, and weak;<br/>
    And his black curls were dewy with the spray,<br/>
Which weigh&rsquo;d upon them yet, all damp and salt,<br/>
Mix&rsquo;d with the stony vapours of the vault.<br/>
<br/>
And she bent o&rsquo;er him, and he lay beneath,<br/>
    Hush&rsquo;d as the babe upon its mother&rsquo;s breast,<br/>
Droop&rsquo;d as the willow when no winds can breathe,<br/>
    Lull&rsquo;d like the depth of ocean when at rest,<br/>
Fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath,<br/>
    Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest;<br/>
In short, he was a very pretty fellow,<br/>
Although his woes had turn&rsquo;d him rather yellow.<br/>
<br/>
He woke and gazed, and would have slept again,<br/>
    But the fair face which met his eyes forbade<br/>
Those eyes to close, though weariness and pain<br/>
    Had further sleep a further pleasure made;<br/>
For woman&rsquo;s face was never form&rsquo;d in vain<br/>
    For Juan, so that even when he pray&rsquo;d<br/>
He turn&rsquo;d from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,<br/>
To the sweet portraits of the Virgin Mary.<br/>
<br/>
And thus upon his elbow he arose,<br/>
    And look&rsquo;d upon the lady, in whose cheek<br/>
The pale contended with the purple rose,<br/>
    As with an effort she began to speak;<br/>
Her eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,<br/>
    Although she told him, in good modern Greek,<br/>
With an Ionian accent, low and sweet,<br/>
That he was faint, and must not talk, but eat.<br/>
<br/>
Now Juan could not understand a word,<br/>
    Being no Grecian; but he had an ear,<br/>
And her voice was the warble of a bird,<br/>
    So soft, so sweet, so delicately clear,<br/>
That finer, simpler music ne&rsquo;er was heard;<br/>
    The sort of sound we echo with a tear,<br/>
Without knowing why&mdash;an overpowering tone,<br/>
Whence Melody descends as from a throne.<br/>
<br/>
And Juan gazed as one who is awoke<br/>
    By a distant organ, doubting if he be<br/>
Not yet a dreamer, till the spell is broke<br/>
    By the watchman, or some such reality,<br/>
Or by one&rsquo;s early valet&rsquo;s cursed knock;<br/>
    At least it is a heavy sound to me,<br/>
Who like a morning slumber&mdash;for the night<br/>
Shows stars and women in a better light.<br/>
<br/>
And Juan, too, was help&rsquo;d out from his dream,<br/>
    Or sleep, or whatso&rsquo;er it was, by feeling<br/>
A most prodigious appetite: the steam<br/>
    Of Zoe&rsquo;s cookery no doubt was stealing<br/>
Upon his senses, and the kindling beam<br/>
    Of the new fire, which Zoe kept up, kneeling<br/>
To stir her viands, made him quite awake<br/>
And long for food, but chiefly a beef-steak.<br/>
<br/>
But beef is rare within these oxless isles;<br/>
    Goat&rsquo;s flesh there is, no doubt, and kid, and mutton;<br/>
And, when a holiday upon them smiles,<br/>
    A joint upon their barbarous spits they put on:<br/>
But this occurs but seldom, between whiles,<br/>
    For some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on;<br/>
Others are fair and fertile, among which<br/>
This, though not large, was one of the most rich.<br/>
<br/>
I say that beef is rare, and can&rsquo;t help thinking<br/>
    That the old fable of the Minotaur&mdash;<br/>
From which our modern morals rightly shrinking<br/>
    Condemn the royal lady&rsquo;s taste who wore<br/>
A cow&rsquo;s shape for a mask&mdash;was only (sinking<br/>
    The allegory) a mere type, no more,<br/>
That Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle,<br/>
To make the Cretans bloodier in battle.<br/>
<br/>
For we all know that English people are<br/>
    Fed upon beef&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say much of beer,<br/>
Because &rsquo;tis liquor only, and being far<br/>
    From this my subject, has no business here;<br/>
We know, too, they very fond of war,<br/>
    A pleasure&mdash;like all pleasures&mdash;rather dear;<br/>
So were the Cretans&mdash;from which I infer<br/>
That beef and battles both were owing to her.<br/>
<br/>
But to resume. The languid Juan raised<br/>
    His head upon his elbow, and he saw<br/>
A sight on which he had not lately gazed,<br/>
    As all his latter meals had been quite raw,<br/>
Three or four things, for which the Lord he praised,<br/>
    And, feeling still the famish&rsquo;d vulture gnaw,<br/>
He fell upon whate&rsquo;er was offer&rsquo;d, like<br/>
A priest, a shark, an alderman, or pike.<br/>
<br/>
He ate, and he was well supplied: and she,<br/>
    Who watch&rsquo;d him like a mother, would have fed<br/>
Him past all bounds, because she smiled to see<br/>
    Such appetite in one she had deem&rsquo;d dead;<br/>
But Zoe, being older than Haidee,<br/>
    Knew (by tradition, for she ne&rsquo;er had read)<br/>
That famish&rsquo;d people must be slowly nurst,<br/>
And fed by spoonfuls, else they always burst.<br/>
<br/>
And so she took the liberty to state,<br/>
    Rather by deeds than words, because the case<br/>
Was urgent, that the gentleman, whose fate<br/>
    Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace<br/>
The sea-shore at this hour, must leave his plate,<br/>
    Unless he wish&rsquo;d to die upon the place&mdash;<br/>
She snatch&rsquo;d it, and refused another morsel,<br/>
Saying, he had gorged enough to make a horse ill.<br/>
<br/>
Next they&mdash;he being naked, save a tatter&rsquo;d<br/>
    Pair of scarce decent trowsers&mdash;went to work,<br/>
And in the fire his recent rags they scatter&rsquo;d,<br/>
    And dress&rsquo;d him, for the present, like a Turk,<br/>
Or Greek&mdash;that is, although it not much matter&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Omitting turban, slippers, pistols, dirk,&mdash;<br/>
They furnish&rsquo;d him, entire, except some stitches,<br/>
With a clean shirt, and very spacious breeches.<br/>
<br/>
And then fair Haidee tried her tongue at speaking,<br/>
    But not a word could Juan comprehend,<br/>
Although he listen&rsquo;d so that the young Greek in<br/>
    Her earnestness would ne&rsquo;er have made an end;<br/>
And, as he interrupted not, went eking<br/>
    Her speech out to her protege and friend,<br/>
Till pausing at the last her breath to take,<br/>
She saw he did not understand Romaic.<br/>
<br/>
And then she had recourse to nods, and signs,<br/>
    And smiles, and sparkles of the speaking eye,<br/>
And read (the only book she could) the lines<br/>
    Of his fair face, and found, by sympathy,<br/>
The answer eloquent, where soul shines<br/>
    And darts in one quick glance a long reply;<br/>
And thus in every look she saw exprest<br/>
A world of words, and things at which she guess&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
And now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,<br/>
    And words repeated after her, he took<br/>
A lesson in her tongue; but by surmise,<br/>
    No doubt, less of her language than her look:<br/>
As he who studies fervently the skies<br/>
    Turns oftener to the stars than to his book,<br/>
Thus Juan learn&rsquo;d his alpha beta better<br/>
From Haidee&rsquo;s glance than any graven letter.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis pleasing to be school&rsquo;d in a strange tongue<br/>
    By female lips and eyes&mdash;that is, I mean,<br/>
When both the teacher and the taught are young,<br/>
    As was the case, at least, where I have been;<br/>
They smile so when one &rsquo;s right, and when one &rsquo;s wrong<br/>
    They smile still more, and then there intervene<br/>
Pressure of hands, perhaps even a chaste kiss;&mdash;<br/>
I learn&rsquo;d the little that I know by this:<br/>
<br/>
That is, some words of Spanish, Turk, and Greek,<br/>
    Italian not at all, having no teachers;<br/>
Much English I cannot pretend to speak,<br/>
    Learning that language chiefly from its preachers,<br/>
Barrow, South, Tillotson, whom every week<br/>
    I study, also Blair, the highest reachers<br/>
Of eloquence in piety and prose&mdash;<br/>
I hate your poets, so read none of those.<br/>
<br/>
As for the ladies, I have nought to say,<br/>
    A wanderer from the British world of fashion,<br/>
Where I, like other &lsquo;dogs, have had my day,&rsquo;<br/>
    Like other men, too, may have had my passion&mdash;<br/>
But that, like other things, has pass&rsquo;d away,<br/>
    And all her fools whom I could lay the lash on:<br/>
Foes, friends, men, women, now are nought to me<br/>
But dreams of what has been, no more to be.<br/>
<br/>
Return we to Don Juan. He begun<br/>
    To hear new words, and to repeat them; but<br/>
Some feelings, universal as the sun,<br/>
    Were such as could not in his breast be shut<br/>
More than within the bosom of a nun:<br/>
    He was in love,&mdash;as you would be, no doubt,<br/>
With a young benefactress,&mdash;so was she,<br/>
Just in the way we very often see.<br/>
<br/>
And every day by daybreak&mdash;rather early<br/>
    For Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest&mdash;<br/>
She came into the cave, but it was merely<br/>
    To see her bird reposing in his nest;<br/>
And she would softly stir his locks so curly,<br/>
    Without disturbing her yet slumbering guest,<br/>
Breathing all gently o&rsquo;er his cheek and mouth,<br/>
As o&rsquo;er a bed of roses the sweet south.<br/>
<br/>
And every morn his colour freshlier came,<br/>
    And every day help&rsquo;d on his convalescence;<br/>
&rsquo;Twas well, because health in the human frame<br/>
    Is pleasant, besides being true love&rsquo;s essence,<br/>
For health and idleness to passion&rsquo;s flame<br/>
    Are oil and gunpowder; and some good lessons<br/>
Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus,<br/>
Without whom Venus will not long attack us.<br/>
<br/>
While Venus fills the heart (without heart really<br/>
    Love, though good always, is not quite so good),<br/>
Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli,&mdash;<br/>
    For love must be sustain&rsquo;d like flesh and blood,&mdash;<br/>
While Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly:<br/>
    Eggs, oysters, too, are amatory food;<br/>
But who is their purveyor from above<br/>
Heaven knows,&mdash;it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove.<br/>
<br/>
When Juan woke he found some good things ready,<br/>
    A bath, a breakfast, and the finest eyes<br/>
That ever made a youthful heart less steady,<br/>
    Besides her maid&rsquo;s as pretty for their size;<br/>
But I have spoken of all this already&mdash;<br/>
    And repetition &rsquo;s tiresome and unwise,&mdash;<br/>
Well&mdash;Juan, after bathing in the sea,<br/>
Came always back to coffee and Haidee.<br/>
<br/>
Both were so young, and one so innocent,<br/>
    That bathing pass&rsquo;d for nothing; Juan seem&rsquo;d<br/>
To her, as &rsquo;twere, the kind of being sent,<br/>
    Of whom these two years she had nightly dream&rsquo;d,<br/>
A something to be loved, a creature meant<br/>
    To be her happiness, and whom she deem&rsquo;d<br/>
To render happy; all who joy would win<br/>
Must share it,&mdash;Happiness was born a twin.<br/>
<br/>
It was such pleasure to behold him, such<br/>
    Enlargement of existence to partake<br/>
Nature with him, to thrill beneath his touch,<br/>
    To watch him slumbering, and to see him wake:<br/>
To live with him forever were too much;<br/>
    But then the thought of parting made her quake;<br/>
He was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast<br/>
Like a rich wreck&mdash;her first love, and her last.<br/>
<br/>
And thus a moon roll&rsquo;d on, and fair Haidee<br/>
    Paid daily visits to her boy, and took<br/>
Such plentiful precautions, that still he<br/>
    Remain&rsquo;d unknown within his craggy nook;<br/>
At last her father&rsquo;s prows put out to sea<br/>
    For certain merchantmen upon the look,<br/>
Not as of yore to carry off an Io,<br/>
But three Ragusan vessels, bound for Scio.<br/>
<br/>
Then came her freedom, for she had no mother,<br/>
    So that, her father being at sea, she was<br/>
Free as a married woman, or such other<br/>
    Female, as where she likes may freely pass,<br/>
Without even the incumbrance of a brother,<br/>
    The freest she that ever gazed on glass;<br/>
I speak of Christian lands in this comparison,<br/>
Where wives, at least, are seldom kept in garrison.<br/>
<br/>
Now she prolong&rsquo;d her visits and her talk<br/>
    (For they must talk), and he had learnt to say<br/>
So much as to propose to take a walk,&mdash;<br/>
    For little had he wander&rsquo;d since the day<br/>
On which, like a young flower snapp&rsquo;d from the stalk,<br/>
    Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay,&mdash;<br/>
And thus they walk&rsquo;d out in the afternoon,<br/>
And saw the sun set opposite the moon.<br/>
<br/>
It was a wild and breaker-beaten coast,<br/>
    With cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,<br/>
Guarded by shoals and rocks as by an host,<br/>
    With here and there a creek, whose aspect wore<br/>
A better welcome to the tempest-tost;<br/>
    And rarely ceased the haughty billow&rsquo;s roar,<br/>
Save on the dead long summer days, which make<br/>
The outstretch&rsquo;d ocean glitter like a lake.<br/>
<br/>
And the small ripple spilt upon the beach<br/>
    Scarcely o&rsquo;erpass&rsquo;d the cream of your champagne,<br/>
When o&rsquo;er the brim the sparkling bumpers reach,<br/>
    That spring-dew of the spirit! the heart&rsquo;s rain!<br/>
Few things surpass old wine; and they may preach<br/>
    Who please,&mdash;the more because they preach in vain,&mdash;<br/>
Let us have wine and women, mirth and laughter,<br/>
Sermons and soda-water the day after.<br/>
<br/>
Man, being reasonable, must get drunk;<br/>
    The best of life is but intoxication:<br/>
Glory, the grape, love, gold, in these are sunk<br/>
    The hopes of all men, and of every nation;<br/>
Without their sap, how branchless were the trunk<br/>
    Of life&rsquo;s strange tree, so fruitful on occasion:<br/>
But to return,&mdash;Get very drunk; and when<br/>
You wake with headache, you shall see what then.<br/>
<br/>
Ring for your valet&mdash;bid him quickly bring<br/>
    Some hock and soda-water, then you&rsquo;ll know<br/>
A pleasure worthy Xerxes the great king;<br/>
    For not the bless&rsquo;d sherbet, sublimed with snow,<br/>
Nor the first sparkle of the desert-spring,<br/>
    Nor Burgundy in all its sunset glow,<br/>
After long travel, ennui, love, or slaughter,<br/>
Vie with that draught of hock and soda-water.<br/>
<br/>
The coast&mdash;I think it was the coast that<br/>
    Was just describing&mdash;Yes, it was the coast&mdash;<br/>
Lay at this period quiet as the sky,<br/>
    The sands untumbled, the blue waves untost,<br/>
And all was stillness, save the sea-bird&rsquo;s cry,<br/>
    And dolphin&rsquo;s leap, and little billow crost<br/>
By some low rock or shelve, that made it fret<br/>
Against the boundary it scarcely wet.<br/>
<br/>
And forth they wander&rsquo;d, her sire being gone,<br/>
    As I have said, upon an expedition;<br/>
And mother, brother, guardian, she had none,<br/>
    Save Zoe, who, although with due precision<br/>
She waited on her lady with the sun,<br/>
    Thought daily service was her only mission,<br/>
Bringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,<br/>
And asking now and then for cast-off dresses.<br/>
<br/>
It was the cooling hour, just when the rounded<br/>
    Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill,<br/>
Which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,<br/>
    Circling all nature, hush&rsquo;d, and dim, and still,<br/>
With the far mountain-crescent half surrounded<br/>
    On one side, and the deep sea calm and chill<br/>
Upon the other, and the rosy sky,<br/>
With one star sparkling through it like an eye.<br/>
<br/>
And thus they wander&rsquo;d forth, and hand in hand,<br/>
    Over the shining pebbles and the shells,<br/>
Glided along the smooth and harden&rsquo;d sand,<br/>
    And in the worn and wild receptacles<br/>
Work&rsquo;d by the storms, yet work&rsquo;d as it were plann&rsquo;d,<br/>
    In hollow halls, with sparry roofs and cells,<br/>
They turn&rsquo;d to rest; and, each clasp&rsquo;d by an arm,<br/>
Yielded to the deep twilight&rsquo;s purple charm.<br/>
<br/>
They look&rsquo;d up to the sky, whose floating glow<br/>
    Spread like a rosy ocean, vast and bright;<br/>
They gazed upon the glittering sea below,<br/>
    Whence the broad moon rose circling into sight;<br/>
They heard the wave&rsquo;s splash, and the wind so low,<br/>
    And saw each other&rsquo;s dark eyes darting light<br/>
Into each other&mdash;and, beholding this,<br/>
Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;<br/>
<br/>
A long, long kiss, a kiss of youth, and love,<br/>
    And beauty, all concentrating like rays<br/>
Into one focus, kindled from above;<br/>
    Such kisses as belong to early days,<br/>
Where heart, and soul, and sense, in concert move,<br/>
    And the blood &rsquo;s lava, and the pulse a blaze,<br/>
Each kiss a heart-quake,&mdash;for a kiss&rsquo;s strength,<br/>
I think, it must be reckon&rsquo;d by its length.<br/>
<br/>
By length I mean duration; theirs endured<br/>
    Heaven knows how long&mdash;no doubt they never reckon&rsquo;d;<br/>
And if they had, they could not have secured<br/>
    The sum of their sensations to a second:<br/>
They had not spoken; but they felt allured,<br/>
    As if their souls and lips each other beckon&rsquo;d,<br/>
Which, being join&rsquo;d, like swarming bees they clung&mdash;<br/>
Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.<br/>
<br/>
They were alone, but not alone as they<br/>
    Who shut in chambers think it loneliness;<br/>
The silent ocean, and the starlight bay,<br/>
    The twilight glow which momently grew less,<br/>
The voiceless sands and dropping caves, that lay<br/>
    Around them, made them to each other press,<br/>
As if there were no life beneath the sky<br/>
Save theirs, and that their life could never die.<br/>
<br/>
They fear&rsquo;d no eyes nor ears on that lone beach,<br/>
    They felt no terrors from the night, they were<br/>
All in all to each other: though their speech<br/>
    Was broken words, they thought a language there,&mdash;<br/>
And all the burning tongues the passions teach<br/>
    Found in one sigh the best interpreter<br/>
Of nature&rsquo;s oracle&mdash;first love,&mdash;that all<br/>
Which Eve has left her daughters since her fall.<br/>
<br/>
Haidde spoke not of scruples, ask&rsquo;d no vows,<br/>
    Nor offer&rsquo;d any; she had never heard<br/>
Of plight and promises to be a spouse,<br/>
    Or perils by a loving maid incurr&rsquo;d;<br/>
She was all which pure ignorance allows,<br/>
    And flew to her young mate like a young bird;<br/>
And, never having dreamt of falsehood, she<br/>
Had not one word to say of constancy.<br/>
<br/>
She loved, and was beloved&mdash;she adored,<br/>
    And she was worshipp&rsquo;d; after nature&rsquo;s fashion,<br/>
Their intense souls, into each other pour&rsquo;d,<br/>
    If souls could die, had perish&rsquo;d in that passion,&mdash;<br/>
But by degrees their senses were restored,<br/>
    Again to be o&rsquo;ercome, again to dash on;<br/>
And, beating &rsquo;gainst his bosom, Haidee&rsquo;s heart<br/>
Felt as if never more to beat apart.<br/>
<br/>
Alas! they were so young, so beautiful,<br/>
    So lonely, loving, helpless, and the hour<br/>
Was that in which the heart is always full,<br/>
    And, having o&rsquo;er itself no further power,<br/>
Prompts deeds eternity can not annul,<br/>
    But pays off moments in an endless shower<br/>
Of hell-fire&mdash;all prepared for people giving<br/>
Pleasure or pain to one another living.<br/>
<br/>
Alas! for Juan and Haidee! they were<br/>
    So loving and so lovely&mdash;till then never,<br/>
Excepting our first parents, such a pair<br/>
    Had run the risk of being damn&rsquo;d for ever;<br/>
And Haidee, being devout as well as fair,<br/>
    Had, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,<br/>
And hell and purgatory&mdash;but forgot<br/>
Just in the very crisis she should not.<br/>
<br/>
They look upon each other, and their eyes<br/>
    Gleam in the moonlight; and her white arm clasps<br/>
Round Juan&rsquo;s head, and his around her lies<br/>
    Half buried in the tresses which it grasps;<br/>
She sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,<br/>
    He hers, until they end in broken gasps;<br/>
And thus they form a group that &rsquo;s quite antique,<br/>
Half naked, loving, natural, and Greek.<br/>
<br/>
And when those deep and burning moments pass&rsquo;d,<br/>
    And Juan sunk to sleep within her arms,<br/>
She slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,<br/>
    Sustain&rsquo;d his head upon her bosom&rsquo;s charms;<br/>
And now and then her eye to heaven is cast,<br/>
    And then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,<br/>
Pillow&rsquo;d on her o&rsquo;erflowing heart, which pants<br/>
With all it granted, and with all it grants.<br/>
<br/>
An infant when it gazes on a light,<br/>
    A child the moment when it drains the breast,<br/>
A devotee when soars the Host in sight,<br/>
    An Arab with a stranger for a guest,<br/>
A sailor when the prize has struck in fight,<br/>
    A miser filling his most hoarded chest,<br/>
Feel rapture; but not such true joy are reaping<br/>
As they who watch o&rsquo;er what they love while sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
For there it lies so tranquil, so beloved,<br/>
    All that it hath of life with us is living;<br/>
So gentle, stirless, helpless, and unmoved,<br/>
    And all unconscious of the joy &rsquo;tis giving;<br/>
All it hath felt, inflicted, pass&rsquo;d, and proved,<br/>
    Hush&rsquo;d into depths beyond the watcher&rsquo;s diving:<br/>
There lies the thing we love with all its errors<br/>
And all its charms, like death without its terrors.<br/>
<br/>
The lady watch&rsquo;d her lover&mdash;and that hour<br/>
    Of Love&rsquo;s, and Night&rsquo;s, and Ocean&rsquo;s solitude,<br/>
O&rsquo;erflow&rsquo;d her soul with their united power;<br/>
    Amidst the barren sand and rocks so rude<br/>
She and her wave-worn love had made their bower,<br/>
    Where nought upon their passion could intrude,<br/>
And all the stars that crowded the blue space<br/>
Saw nothing happier than her glowing face.<br/>
<br/>
Alas! the love of women! it is known<br/>
    To be a lovely and a fearful thing;<br/>
For all of theirs upon that die is thrown,<br/>
    And if &rsquo;tis lost, life hath no more to bring<br/>
To them but mockeries of the past alone,<br/>
    And their revenge is as the tiger&rsquo;s spring,<br/>
Deadly, and quick, and crushing; yet, as real<br/>
Torture is theirs, what they inflict they feel.<br/>
<br/>
They are right; for man, to man so oft unjust,<br/>
    Is always so to women; one sole bond<br/>
Awaits them, treachery is all their trust;<br/>
    Taught to conceal, their bursting hearts despond<br/>
Over their idol, till some wealthier lust<br/>
    Buys them in marriage&mdash;and what rests beyond?<br/>
A thankless husband, next a faithless lover,<br/>
Then dressing, nursing, praying, and all &rsquo;s over.<br/>
<br/>
Some take a lover, some take drams or prayers,<br/>
    Some mind their household, others dissipation,<br/>
Some run away, and but exchange their cares,<br/>
    Losing the advantage of a virtuous station;<br/>
Few changes e&rsquo;er can better their affairs,<br/>
    Theirs being an unnatural situation,<br/>
From the dull palace to the dirty hovel:<br/>
Some play the devil, and then write a novel.<br/>
<br/>
Haidee was Nature&rsquo;s bride, and knew not this;<br/>
    Haidee was Passion&rsquo;s child, born where the sun<br/>
Showers triple light, and scorches even the kiss<br/>
    Of his gazelle-eyed daughters; she was one<br/>
Made but to love, to feel that she was his<br/>
    Who was her chosen: what was said or done<br/>
Elsewhere was nothing. She had naught to fear,<br/>
Hope, care, nor love, beyond, her heart beat here.<br/>
<br/>
And oh! that quickening of the heart, that beat!<br/>
    How much it costs us! yet each rising throb<br/>
Is in its cause as its effect so sweet,<br/>
    That Wisdom, ever on the watch to rob<br/>
Joy of its alchymy, and to repeat<br/>
    Fine truths; even Conscience, too, has a tough job<br/>
To make us understand each good old maxim,<br/>
So good&mdash;I wonder Castlereagh don&rsquo;t tax &rsquo;em.<br/>
<br/>
And now &rsquo;twas done&mdash;on the lone shore were plighted<br/>
    Their hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed<br/>
Beauty upon the beautiful they lighted:<br/>
    Ocean their witness, and the cave their bed,<br/>
By their own feelings hallow&rsquo;d and united,<br/>
    Their priest was Solitude, and they were wed:<br/>
And they were happy, for to their young eyes<br/>
Each was an angel, and earth paradise.<br/>
<br/>
O, Love! of whom great Caesar was the suitor,<br/>
    Titus the master, Antony the slave,<br/>
Horace, Catullus, scholars, Ovid tutor,<br/>
    Sappho the sage blue-stocking, in whose grave<br/>
All those may leap who rather would be neuter<br/>
    (Leucadia&rsquo;s rock still overlooks the wave)&mdash;<br/>
O, Love! thou art the very god of evil,<br/>
For, after all, we cannot call thee devil.<br/>
<br/>
Thou mak&rsquo;st the chaste connubial state precarious,<br/>
    And jestest with the brows of mightiest men:<br/>
Caesar and Pompey, Mahomet, Belisarius,<br/>
    Have much employ&rsquo;d the muse of history&rsquo;s pen;<br/>
Their lives and fortunes were extremely various,<br/>
    Such worthies Time will never see again;<br/>
Yet to these four in three things the same luck holds,<br/>
They all were heroes, conquerors, and cuckolds.<br/>
<br/>
Thou mak&rsquo;st philosophers; there&rsquo;s Epicurus<br/>
    And Aristippus, a material crew!<br/>
Who to immoral courses would allure us<br/>
    By theories quite practicable too;<br/>
If only from the devil they would insure us,<br/>
    How pleasant were the maxim (not quite new),<br/>
&lsquo;Eat, drink, and love, what can the rest avail us?&rsquo;<br/>
So said the royal sage Sardanapalus.<br/>
<br/>
But Juan! had he quite forgotten Julia?<br/>
    And should he have forgotten her so soon?<br/>
I can&rsquo;t but say it seems to me most truly<br/>
    Perplexing question; but, no doubt, the moon<br/>
Does these things for us, and whenever newly<br/>
    Strong palpitation rises, &rsquo;tis her boon,<br/>
Else how the devil is it that fresh features<br/>
Have such a charm for us poor human creatures?<br/>
<br/>
I hate inconstancy&mdash;I loathe, detest,<br/>
    Abhor, condemn, abjure the mortal made<br/>
Of such quicksilver clay that in his breast<br/>
    No permanent foundation can be laid;<br/>
Love, constant love, has been my constant guest,<br/>
    And yet last night, being at a masquerade,<br/>
I saw the prettiest creature, fresh from Milan,<br/>
Which gave me some sensations like a villain.<br/>
<br/>
But soon Philosophy came to my aid,<br/>
    And whisper&rsquo;d, &lsquo;Think of every sacred tie!&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;I will, my dear Philosophy!&rsquo; I said,<br/>
    &lsquo;But then her teeth, and then, oh, Heaven! her eye!<br/>
I&rsquo;ll just inquire if she be wife or maid,<br/>
    Or neither&mdash;out of curiosity.&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; cried Philosophy, with air so Grecian<br/>
(Though she was masqued then as a fair Venetian);<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; so I stopp&rsquo;d.&mdash;But to return: that which<br/>
    Men call inconstancy is nothing more<br/>
Than admiration due where nature&rsquo;s rich<br/>
    Profusion with young beauty covers o&rsquo;er<br/>
Some favour&rsquo;d object; and as in the niche<br/>
    A lovely statue we almost adore,<br/>
This sort of adoration of the real<br/>
Is but a heightening of the &lsquo;beau ideal.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis the perception of the beautiful,<br/>
    A fine extension of the faculties,<br/>
Platonic, universal, wonderful,<br/>
    Drawn from the stars, and filter&rsquo;d through the skies,<br/>
Without which life would be extremely dull;<br/>
    In short, it is the use of our own eyes,<br/>
With one or two small senses added, just<br/>
To hint that flesh is form&rsquo;d of fiery dust.<br/>
<br/>
Yet &rsquo;tis a painful feeling, and unwilling,<br/>
    For surely if we always could perceive<br/>
In the same object graces quite as killing<br/>
    As when she rose upon us like an Eve,<br/>
&rsquo;Twould save us many a heartache, many a shilling<br/>
    (For we must get them any how or grieve),<br/>
Whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever,<br/>
How pleasant for the heart as well as liver!<br/>
<br/>
The heart is like the sky, a part of heaven,<br/>
    But changes night and day, too, like the sky;<br/>
Now o&rsquo;er it clouds and thunder must be driven,<br/>
    And darkness and destruction as on high:<br/>
But when it hath been scorch&rsquo;d, and pierced, and riven,<br/>
    Its storms expire in water-drops; the eye<br/>
Pours forth at last the heart&rsquo;s blood turn&rsquo;d to tears,<br/>
Which make the English climate of our years.<br/>
<br/>
The liver is the lazaret of bile,<br/>
    But very rarely executes its function,<br/>
For the first passion stays there such a while,<br/>
    That all the rest creep in and form a junction,<br/>
Life knots of vipers on a dunghill&rsquo;s soil,&mdash;<br/>
    Rage, fear, hate, jealousy, revenge, compunction,&mdash;<br/>
So that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail,<br/>
Like earthquakes from the hidden fire call&rsquo;d &lsquo;central,&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, without proceeding more<br/>
    In this anatomy, I&rsquo;ve finish&rsquo;d now<br/>
Two hundred and odd stanzas as before,<br/>
    That being about the number I&rsquo;ll allow<br/>
Each canto of the twelve, or twenty-four;<br/>
    And, laying down my pen, I make my bow,<br/>
Leaving Don Juan and Haidee to plead<br/>
For them and theirs with all who deign to read.<br/>

CANTO THE THIRD.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
Hail, Muse! et cetera.&mdash;We left Juan sleeping,<br/>
    Pillow&rsquo;d upon a fair and happy breast,<br/>
And watch&rsquo;d by eyes that never yet knew weeping,<br/>
    And loved by a young heart, too deeply blest<br/>
To feel the poison through her spirit creeping,<br/>
    Or know who rested there, a foe to rest,<br/>
Had soil&rsquo;d the current of her sinless years,<br/>
And turn&rsquo;d her pure heart&rsquo;s purest blood to tears!<br/>
<br/>
O, Love! what is it in this world of ours<br/>
    Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah, why<br/>
With cypress branches hast thou Wreathed thy bowers,<br/>
    And made thy best interpreter a sigh?<br/>
As those who dote on odours pluck the flowers,<br/>
    And place them on their breast&mdash;but place to die&mdash;<br/>
Thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish<br/>
Are laid within our bosoms but to perish.<br/>
<br/>
In her first passion woman loves her lover,<br/>
    In all the others all she loves is love,<br/>
Which grows a habit she can ne&rsquo;er get over,<br/>
    And fits her loosely&mdash;like an easy glove,<br/>
As you may find, whene&rsquo;er you like to prove her:<br/>
    One man alone at first her heart can move;<br/>
She then prefers him in the plural number,<br/>
Not finding that the additions much encumber.<br/>
<br/>
I know not if the fault be men&rsquo;s or theirs;<br/>
    But one thing &rsquo;s pretty sure; a woman planted<br/>
(Unless at once she plunge for life in prayers)<br/>
    After a decent time must be gallanted;<br/>
Although, no doubt, her first of love affairs<br/>
    Is that to which her heart is wholly granted;<br/>
Yet there are some, they say, who have had none,<br/>
But those who have ne&rsquo;er end with only one.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis melancholy, and a fearful sign<br/>
    Of human frailty, folly, also crime,<br/>
That love and marriage rarely can combine,<br/>
    Although they both are born in the same clime;<br/>
Marriage from love, like vinegar from wine&mdash;<br/>
    A sad, sour, sober beverage&mdash;by time<br/>
Is sharpen&rsquo;d from its high celestial flavour<br/>
Down to a very homely household savour.<br/>
<br/>
There&rsquo;s something of antipathy, as &rsquo;twere,<br/>
    Between their present and their future state;<br/>
A kind of flattery that &rsquo;s hardly fair<br/>
    Is used until the truth arrives too late&mdash;<br/>
Yet what can people do, except despair?<br/>
    The same things change their names at such a rate;<br/>
For instance&mdash;passion in a lover &rsquo;s glorious,<br/>
But in a husband is pronounced uxorious.<br/>
<br/>
Men grow ashamed of being so very fond;<br/>
    They sometimes also get a little tired<br/>
(But that, of course, is rare), and then despond:<br/>
    The same things cannot always be admired,<br/>
Yet &rsquo;tis &lsquo;so nominated in the bond,&rsquo;<br/>
    That both are tied till one shall have expired.<br/>
Sad thought! to lose the spouse that was adorning<br/>
Our days, and put one&rsquo;s servants into mourning.<br/>
<br/>
There&rsquo;s doubtless something in domestic doings<br/>
    Which forms, in fact, true love&rsquo;s antithesis;<br/>
Romances paint at full length people&rsquo;s wooings,<br/>
    But only give a bust of marriages;<br/>
For no one cares for matrimonial cooings,<br/>
    There&rsquo;s nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:<br/>
Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch&rsquo;s wife,<br/>
He would have written sonnets all his life?<br/>
<br/>
All tragedies are finish&rsquo;d by a death,<br/>
    All comedies are ended by a marriage;<br/>
The future states of both are left to faith,<br/>
    For authors fear description might disparage<br/>
The worlds to come of both, or fall beneath,<br/>
    And then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;<br/>
So leaving each their priest and prayer-book ready,<br/>
They say no more of Death or of the Lady.<br/>
<br/>
The only two that in my recollection<br/>
    Have sung of heaven and hell, or marriage, are<br/>
Dante and Milton, and of both the affection<br/>
    Was hapless in their nuptials, for some bar<br/>
Of fault or temper ruin&rsquo;d the connection<br/>
    (Such things, in fact, it don&rsquo;t ask much to mar):<br/>
But Dante&rsquo;s Beatrice and Milton&rsquo;s Eve<br/>
Were not drawn from their spouses, you conceive.<br/>
<br/>
Some persons say that Dante meant theology<br/>
    By Beatrice, and not a mistress&mdash;I,<br/>
Although my opinion may require apology,<br/>
    Deem this a commentator&rsquo;s fantasy,<br/>
Unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he<br/>
    Decided thus, and show&rsquo;d good reason why;<br/>
I think that Dante&rsquo;s more abstruse ecstatics<br/>
Meant to personify the mathematics.<br/>
<br/>
Haidee and Juan were not married, but<br/>
    The fault was theirs, not mine; it is not fair,<br/>
Chaste reader, then, in any way to put<br/>
    The blame on me, unless you wish they were;<br/>
Then if you&rsquo;d have them wedded, please to shut<br/>
    The book which treats of this erroneous pair,<br/>
Before the consequences grow too awful;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis dangerous to read of loves unlawful.<br/>
<br/>
Yet they were happy,&mdash;happy in the illicit<br/>
    Indulgence of their innocent desires;<br/>
But more imprudent grown with every visit,<br/>
    Haidee forgot the island was her sire&rsquo;s;<br/>
When we have what we like, &rsquo;tis hard to miss it,<br/>
    At least in the beginning, ere one tires;<br/>
Thus she came often, not a moment losing,<br/>
Whilst her piratical papa was cruising.<br/>
<br/>
Let not his mode of raising cash seem strange,<br/>
    Although he fleeced the flags of every nation,<br/>
For into a prime minister but change<br/>
    His title, and &rsquo;tis nothing but taxation;<br/>
But he, more modest, took an humbler range<br/>
    Of life, and in an honester vocation<br/>
Pursued o&rsquo;er the high seas his watery journey,<br/>
And merely practised as a sea-attorney.<br/>
<br/>
The good old gentleman had been detain&rsquo;d<br/>
    By winds and waves, and some important captures;<br/>
And, in the hope of more, at sea remain&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Although a squall or two had damp&rsquo;d his raptures,<br/>
By swamping one of the prizes; he had chain&rsquo;d<br/>
    His prisoners, dividing them like chapters<br/>
In number&rsquo;d lots; they all had cuffs and collars,<br/>
And averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars.<br/>
<br/>
Some he disposed of off Cape Matapan,<br/>
    Among his friends the Mainots; some he sold<br/>
To his Tunis correspondents, save one man<br/>
    Toss&rsquo;d overboard unsaleable (being old);<br/>
The rest&mdash;save here and there some richer one,<br/>
    Reserved for future ransom&mdash;in the hold<br/>
Were link&rsquo;d alike, as for the common people he<br/>
Had a large order from the Dey of Tripoli.<br/>
<br/>
The merchandise was served in the same way,<br/>
    Pieced out for different marts in the Levant;<br/>
Except some certain portions of the prey,<br/>
    Light classic articles of female want,<br/>
French stuffs, lace, tweezers, toothpicks, teapot, tray,<br/>
    Guitars and castanets from Alicant,<br/>
All which selected from the spoil he gathers,<br/>
Robb&rsquo;d for his daughter by the best of fathers.<br/>
<br/>
A monkey, a Dutch mastiff, a mackaw,<br/>
    Two parrots, with a Persian cat and kittens,<br/>
He chose from several animals he saw&mdash;<br/>
    A terrier, too, which once had been a Briton&rsquo;s,<br/>
Who dying on the coast of Ithaca,<br/>
    The peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance;<br/>
These to secure in this strong blowing weather,<br/>
He caged in one huge hamper altogether.<br/>
<br/>
Then having settled his marine affairs,<br/>
    Despatching single cruisers here and there,<br/>
His vessel having need of some repairs,<br/>
    He shaped his course to where his daughter fair<br/>
Continued still her hospitable cares;<br/>
    But that part of the coast being shoal and bare,<br/>
And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,<br/>
His port lay on the other side o&rsquo; the isle.<br/>
<br/>
And there he went ashore without delay,<br/>
    Having no custom-house nor quarantine<br/>
To ask him awkward questions on the way<br/>
    About the time and place where he had been:<br/>
He left his ship to be hove down next day,<br/>
    With orders to the people to careen;<br/>
So that all hands were busy beyond measure,<br/>
In getting out goods, ballast, guns, and treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Arriving at the summit of a hill<br/>
    Which overlook&rsquo;d the white walls of his home,<br/>
He stopp&rsquo;d.&mdash;What singular emotions fill<br/>
    Their bosoms who have been induced to roam!<br/>
With fluttering doubts if all be well or ill&mdash;<br/>
    With love for many, and with fears for some;<br/>
All feelings which o&rsquo;erleap the years long lost,<br/>
And bring our hearts back to their starting-post.<br/>
<br/>
The approach of home to husbands and to sires,<br/>
    After long travelling by land or water,<br/>
Most naturally some small doubt inspires&mdash;<br/>
    A female family &rsquo;s a serious matter<br/>
(None trusts the sex more, or so much admires&mdash;<br/>
    But they hate flattery, so I never flatter);<br/>
Wives in their husbands&rsquo; absences grow subtler,<br/>
And daughters sometimes run off with the butler.<br/>
<br/>
An honest gentleman at his return<br/>
    May not have the good fortune of Ulysses;<br/>
Not all lone matrons for their husbands mourn,<br/>
    Or show the same dislike to suitors&rsquo; kisses;<br/>
The odds are that he finds a handsome urn<br/>
    To his memory&mdash;and two or three young misses<br/>
Born to some friend, who holds his wife and riches,&mdash;<br/>
And that his Argus&mdash;bites him by the breeches.<br/>
<br/>
If single, probably his plighted fair<br/>
    Has in his absence wedded some rich miser;<br/>
But all the better, for the happy pair<br/>
    May quarrel, and the lady growing wiser,<br/>
He may resume his amatory care<br/>
    As cavalier servente, or despise her;<br/>
And that his sorrow may not be a dumb one,<br/>
Write odes on the Inconstancy of Woman.<br/>
<br/>
And oh! ye gentlemen who have already<br/>
    Some chaste liaison of the kind&mdash;I mean<br/>
An honest friendship with a married lady&mdash;<br/>
    The only thing of this sort ever seen<br/>
To last&mdash;of all connections the most steady,<br/>
    And the true Hymen (the first &rsquo;s but a screen)&mdash;<br/>
Yet for all that keep not too long away,<br/>
I&rsquo;ve known the absent wrong&rsquo;d four times a day.<br/>
<br/>
Lambro, our sea-solicitor, who had<br/>
    Much less experience of dry land than ocean,<br/>
On seeing his own chimney-smoke, felt glad;<br/>
    But not knowing metaphysics, had no notion<br/>
Of the true reason of his not being sad,<br/>
    Or that of any other strong emotion;<br/>
He loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,<br/>
But knew the cause no more than a philosopher.<br/>
<br/>
He saw his white walls shining in the sun,<br/>
    His garden trees all shadowy and green;<br/>
He heard his rivulet&rsquo;s light bubbling run,<br/>
    The distant dog-bark; and perceived between<br/>
The umbrage of the wood so cool and dun<br/>
    The moving figures, and the sparkling sheen<br/>
Of arms (in the East all arm)&mdash;and various dyes<br/>
Of colour&rsquo;d garbs, as bright as butterflies.<br/>
<br/>
And as the spot where they appear he nears,<br/>
    Surprised at these unwonted signs of idling,<br/>
He hears&mdash;alas! no music of the spheres,<br/>
    But an unhallow&rsquo;d, earthly sound of fiddling!<br/>
A melody which made him doubt his ears,<br/>
    The cause being past his guessing or unriddling;<br/>
A pipe, too, and a drum, and shortly after,<br/>
A most unoriental roar of laughter.<br/>
<br/>
And still more nearly to the place advancing,<br/>
    Descending rather quickly the declivity,<br/>
Through the waved branches o&rsquo;er the greensward glancing,<br/>
    &rsquo;Midst other indications of festivity,<br/>
Seeing a troop of his domestics dancing<br/>
    Like dervises, who turn as on a pivot, he<br/>
Perceived it was the Pyrrhic dance so martial,<br/>
To which the Levantines are very partial.<br/>
<br/>
And further on a group of Grecian girls,<br/>
    The first and tallest her white kerchief waving,<br/>
Were strung together like a row of pearls,<br/>
    Link&rsquo;d hand in hand, and dancing; each too having<br/>
Down her white neck long floating auburn curls<br/>
    (The least of which would set ten poets raving);<br/>
Their leader sang&mdash;and bounded to her song,<br/>
With choral step and voice, the virgin throng.<br/>
<br/>
And here, assembled cross-legg&rsquo;d round their trays,<br/>
    Small social parties just begun to dine;<br/>
Pilaus and meats of all sorts met the gaze,<br/>
    And flasks of Samian and of Chian wine,<br/>
And sherbet cooling in the porous vase;<br/>
    Above them their dessert grew on its vine,<br/>
The orange and pomegranate nodding o&rsquo;er<br/>
Dropp&rsquo;d in their laps, scarce pluck&rsquo;d, their mellow store.<br/>
<br/>
A band of children, round a snow-white ram,<br/>
    There wreathe his venerable horns with flowers;<br/>
While peaceful as if still an unwean&rsquo;d lamb,<br/>
    The patriarch of the flock all gently cowers<br/>
His sober head, majestically tame,<br/>
    Or eats from out the palm, or playful lowers<br/>
His brow, as if in act to butt, and then<br/>
Yielding to their small hands, draws back again.<br/>
<br/>
Their classical profiles, and glittering dresses,<br/>
    Their large black eyes, and soft seraphic cheeks,<br/>
Crimson as cleft pomegranates, their long tresses,<br/>
    The gesture which enchants, the eye that speaks,<br/>
The innocence which happy childhood blesses,<br/>
    Made quite a picture of these little Greeks;<br/>
So that the philosophical beholder<br/>
Sigh&rsquo;d for their sakes&mdash;that they should e&rsquo;er grow older.<br/>
<br/>
Afar, a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales<br/>
    To a sedate grey circle of old smokers,<br/>
Of secret treasures found in hidden vales,<br/>
    Of wonderful replies from Arab jokers,<br/>
Of charms to make good gold and cure bad ails,<br/>
    Of rocks bewitch&rsquo;d that open to the knockers,<br/>
Of magic ladies who, by one sole act,<br/>
Transform&rsquo;d their lords to beasts (but that &rsquo;s a fact).<br/>
<br/>
Here was no lack of innocent diversion<br/>
    For the imagination or the senses,<br/>
Song, dance, wine, music, stories from the Persian,<br/>
    All pretty pastimes in which no offence is;<br/>
But Lambro saw all these things with aversion,<br/>
    Perceiving in his absence such expenses,<br/>
Dreading that climax of all human ills,<br/>
The inflammation of his weekly bills.<br/>
<br/>
Ah! what is man? what perils still environ<br/>
    The happiest mortals even after dinner&mdash;<br/>
A day of gold from out an age of iron<br/>
    Is all that life allows the luckiest sinner;<br/>
Pleasure (whene&rsquo;er she sings, at least) &rsquo;s a siren,<br/>
    That lures, to flay alive, the young beginner;<br/>
Lambro&rsquo;s reception at his people&rsquo;s banquet<br/>
Was such as fire accords to a wet blanket.<br/>
<br/>
He&mdash;being a man who seldom used a word<br/>
    Too much, and wishing gladly to surprise<br/>
(In general he surprised men with the sword)<br/>
    His daughter&mdash;had not sent before to advise<br/>
Of his arrival, so that no one stirr&rsquo;d;<br/>
    And long he paused to re-assure his eyes<br/>
In fact much more astonish&rsquo;d than delighted,<br/>
To find so much good company invited.<br/>
<br/>
He did not know (alas! how men will lie)<br/>
    That a report (especially the Greeks)<br/>
Avouch&rsquo;d his death (such people never die),<br/>
    And put his house in mourning several weeks,&mdash;<br/>
But now their eyes and also lips were dry;<br/>
    The bloom, too, had return&rsquo;d to Haidee&rsquo;s cheeks,<br/>
Her tears, too, being return&rsquo;d into their fount,<br/>
She now kept house upon her own account.<br/>
<br/>
Hence all this rice, meat, dancing, wine, and fiddling,<br/>
    Which turn&rsquo;d the isle into a place of pleasure;<br/>
The servants all were getting drunk or idling,<br/>
    A life which made them happy beyond measure.<br/>
Her father&rsquo;s hospitality seem&rsquo;d middling,<br/>
    Compared with what Haidee did with his treasure;<br/>
&rsquo;Twas wonderful how things went on improving,<br/>
While she had not one hour to spare from loving.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you think in stumbling on this feast<br/>
    He flew into a passion, and in fact<br/>
There was no mighty reason to be pleased;<br/>
    Perhaps you prophesy some sudden act,<br/>
The whip, the rack, or dungeon at the least,<br/>
    To teach his people to be more exact,<br/>
And that, proceeding at a very high rate,<br/>
He show&rsquo;d the royal penchants of a pirate.<br/>
<br/>
You&rsquo;re wrong.&mdash;He was the mildest manner&rsquo;d man<br/>
    That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat:<br/>
With such true breeding of a gentleman,<br/>
    You never could divine his real thought;<br/>
No courtier could, and scarcely woman can<br/>
    Gird more deceit within a petticoat;<br/>
Pity he loved adventurous life&rsquo;s variety,<br/>
He was so great a loss to good society.<br/>
<br/>
Advancing to the nearest dinner tray,<br/>
    Tapping the shoulder of the nighest guest,<br/>
With a peculiar smile, which, by the way,<br/>
    Boded no good, whatever it express&rsquo;d,<br/>
He ask&rsquo;d the meaning of this holiday;<br/>
    The vinous Greek to whom he had address&rsquo;d<br/>
His question, much too merry to divine<br/>
The questioner, fill&rsquo;d up a glass of wine,<br/>
<br/>
And without turning his facetious head,<br/>
    Over his shoulder, with a Bacchant air,<br/>
Presented the o&rsquo;erflowing cup, and said,<br/>
    &lsquo;Talking &rsquo;s dry work, I have no time to spare.&rsquo;<br/>
A second hiccup&rsquo;d, &lsquo;Our old master &rsquo;s dead,<br/>
    You&rsquo;d better ask our mistress who &rsquo;s his heir.&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;Our mistress!&rsquo; quoth a third: &lsquo;Our mistress!&mdash;pooh!-<br/>
You mean our master&mdash;not the old, but new.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
These rascals, being new comers, knew not whom<br/>
    They thus address&rsquo;d&mdash;and Lambro&rsquo;s visage fell&mdash;<br/>
And o&rsquo;er his eye a momentary gloom<br/>
    Pass&rsquo;d, but he strove quite courteously to quell<br/>
The expression, and endeavouring to resume<br/>
    His smile, requested one of them to tell<br/>
The name and quality of his new patron,<br/>
Who seem&rsquo;d to have turn&rsquo;d Haidee into a matron.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;I know not,&rsquo; quoth the fellow, &lsquo;who or what<br/>
    He is, nor whence he came&mdash;and little care;<br/>
But this I know, that this roast capon &rsquo;s fat,<br/>
    And that good wine ne&rsquo;er wash&rsquo;d down better fare;<br/>
And if you are not satisfied with that,<br/>
    Direct your questions to my neighbour there;<br/>
He&rsquo;ll answer all for better or for worse,<br/>
For none likes more to hear himself converse.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
I said that Lambro was a man of patience,<br/>
    And certainly he show&rsquo;d the best of breeding,<br/>
Which scarce even France, the paragon of nations,<br/>
    E&rsquo;er saw her most polite of sons exceeding;<br/>
He bore these sneers against his near relations,<br/>
    His own anxiety, his heart, too, bleeding,<br/>
The insults, too, of every servile glutton,<br/>
Who all the time was eating up his mutton.<br/>
<br/>
Now in a person used to much command&mdash;<br/>
    To bid men come, and go, and come again&mdash;<br/>
To see his orders done, too, out of hand&mdash;<br/>
    Whether the word was death, or but the chain&mdash;<br/>
It may seem strange to find his manners bland;<br/>
    Yet such things are, which I can not explain,<br/>
Though doubtless he who can command himself<br/>
Is good to govern&mdash;almost as a Guelf.<br/>
<br/>
Not that he was not sometimes rash or so,<br/>
    But never in his real and serious mood;<br/>
Then calm, concentrated, and still, and slow,<br/>
    He lay coil&rsquo;d like the boa in the wood;<br/>
With him it never was a word and blow,<br/>
    His angry word once o&rsquo;er, he shed no blood,<br/>
But in his silence there was much to rue,<br/>
And his one blow left little work for two.<br/>
<br/>
He ask&rsquo;d no further questions, and proceeded<br/>
    On to the house, but by a private way,<br/>
So that the few who met him hardly heeded,<br/>
    So little they expected him that day;<br/>
If love paternal in his bosom pleaded<br/>
    For Haidee&rsquo;s sake, is more than I can say,<br/>
But certainly to one deem&rsquo;d dead, returning,<br/>
This revel seem&rsquo;d a curious mode of mourning.<br/>
<br/>
If all the dead could now return to life<br/>
    (Which God forbid!) or some, or a great many,<br/>
For instance, if a husband or his wife<br/>
    (Nuptial examples are as good as any),<br/>
No doubt whate&rsquo;er might be their former strife,<br/>
    The present weather would be much more rainy&mdash;<br/>
Tears shed into the grave of the connection<br/>
Would share most probably its resurrection.<br/>
<br/>
He enter&rsquo;d in the house no more his home,<br/>
    A thing to human feelings the most trying,<br/>
And harder for the heart to overcome,<br/>
    Perhaps, than even the mental pangs of dying;<br/>
To find our hearthstone turn&rsquo;d into a tomb,<br/>
    And round its once warm precincts palely lying<br/>
The ashes of our hopes, is a deep grief,<br/>
Beyond a single gentleman&rsquo;s belief.<br/>
<br/>
He enter&rsquo;d in the house&mdash;his home no more,<br/>
    For without hearts there is no home; and felt<br/>
The solitude of passing his own door<br/>
    Without a welcome; there he long had dwelt,<br/>
There his few peaceful days Time had swept o&rsquo;er,<br/>
    There his worn bosom and keen eye would melt<br/>
Over the innocence of that sweet child,<br/>
His only shrine of feelings undefiled.<br/>
<br/>
He was a man of a strange temperament,<br/>
    Of mild demeanour though of savage mood,<br/>
Moderate in all his habits, and content<br/>
    With temperance in pleasure, as in food,<br/>
Quick to perceive, and strong to bear, and meant<br/>
    For something better, if not wholly good;<br/>
His country&rsquo;s wrongs and his despair to save her<br/>
Had stung him from a slave to an enslaver.<br/>
<br/>
The love of power, and rapid gain of gold,<br/>
    The hardness by long habitude produced,<br/>
The dangerous life in which he had grown old,<br/>
    The mercy he had granted oft abused,<br/>
The sights he was accustom&rsquo;d to behold,<br/>
    The wild seas, and wild men with whom he cruised,<br/>
Had cost his enemies a long repentance,<br/>
And made him a good friend, but bad acquaintance.<br/>
<br/>
But something of the spirit of old Greece<br/>
    Flash&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er his soul a few heroic rays,<br/>
Such as lit onward to the Golden Fleece<br/>
    His predecessors in the Colchian days;<br/>
T is true he had no ardent love for peace&mdash;<br/>
    Alas! his country show&rsquo;d no path to praise:<br/>
Hate to the world and war with every nation<br/>
He waged, in vengeance of her degradation.<br/>
<br/>
Still o&rsquo;er his mind the influence of the clime<br/>
    Shed its Ionian elegance, which show&rsquo;d<br/>
Its power unconsciously full many a time,&mdash;<br/>
    A taste seen in the choice of his abode,<br/>
A love of music and of scenes sublime,<br/>
    A pleasure in the gentle stream that flow&rsquo;d<br/>
Past him in crystal, and a joy in flowers,<br/>
Bedew&rsquo;d his spirit in his calmer hours.<br/>
<br/>
But whatsoe&rsquo;er he had of love reposed<br/>
    On that beloved daughter; she had been<br/>
The only thing which kept his heart unclosed<br/>
    Amidst the savage deeds he had done and seen;<br/>
A lonely pure affection unopposed:<br/>
    There wanted but the loss of this to wean<br/>
His feelings from all milk of human kindness,<br/>
And turn him like the Cyclops mad with blindness.<br/>
<br/>
The cubless tigress in her jungle raging<br/>
    Is dreadful to the shepherd and the flock;<br/>
The ocean when its yeasty war is waging<br/>
    Is awful to the vessel near the rock;<br/>
But violent things will sooner bear assuaging,<br/>
    Their fury being spent by its own shock,<br/>
Than the stern, single, deep, and wordless ire<br/>
Of a strong human heart, and in a sire.<br/>
<br/>
It is a hard although a common case<br/>
    To find our children running restive&mdash;they<br/>
In whom our brightest days we would retrace,<br/>
    Our little selves re-form&rsquo;d in finer clay,<br/>
Just as old age is creeping on apace,<br/>
    And clouds come o&rsquo;er the sunset of our day,<br/>
They kindly leave us, though not quite alone,<br/>
But in good company&mdash;the gout or stone.<br/>
<br/>
Yet a fine family is a fine thing<br/>
    (Provided they don&rsquo;t come in after dinner);<br/>
&rsquo;Tis beautiful to see a matron bring<br/>
    Her children up (if nursing them don&rsquo;t thin her);<br/>
Like cherubs round an altar-piece they cling<br/>
    To the fire-side (a sight to touch a sinner).<br/>
A lady with her daughters or her nieces<br/>
Shines like a guinea and seven-shilling pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Old Lambro pass&rsquo;d unseen a private gate,<br/>
    And stood within his hall at eventide;<br/>
Meantime the lady and her lover sate<br/>
    At wassail in their beauty and their pride:<br/>
An ivory inlaid table spread with state<br/>
    Before them, and fair slaves on every side;<br/>
Gems, gold, and silver, form&rsquo;d the service mostly,<br/>
Mother of pearl and coral the less costly.<br/>
<br/>
The dinner made about a hundred dishes;<br/>
    Lamb and pistachio nuts&mdash;in short, all meats,<br/>
And saffron soups, and sweetbreads; and the fishes<br/>
    Were of the finest that e&rsquo;er flounced in nets,<br/>
Drest to a Sybarite&rsquo;s most pamper&rsquo;d wishes;<br/>
    The beverage was various sherbets<br/>
Of raisin, orange, and pomegranate juice,<br/>
Squeezed through the rind, which makes it best for use.<br/>
<br/>
These were ranged round, each in its crystal ewer,<br/>
    And fruits, and date-bread loaves closed the repast,<br/>
And Mocha&rsquo;s berry, from Arabia pure,<br/>
    In small fine China cups, came in at last;<br/>
Gold cups of filigree made to secure<br/>
    The hand from burning underneath them placed,<br/>
Cloves, cinnamon, and saffron too were boil&rsquo;d<br/>
Up with the coffee, which (I think) they spoil&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
The hangings of the room were tapestry, made<br/>
    Of velvet panels, each of different hue,<br/>
And thick with damask flowers of silk inlaid;<br/>
    And round them ran a yellow border too;<br/>
The upper border, richly wrought, display&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Embroider&rsquo;d delicately o&rsquo;er with blue,<br/>
Soft Persian sentences, in lilac letters,<br/>
From poets, or the moralists their betters.<br/>
<br/>
These Oriental writings on the wall,<br/>
    Quite common in those countries, are a kind<br/>
Of monitors adapted to recall,<br/>
    Like skulls at Memphian banquets, to the mind<br/>
The words which shook Belshazzar in his hall,<br/>
    And took his kingdom from him: You will find,<br/>
Though sages may pour out their wisdom&rsquo;s treasure,<br/>
There is no sterner moralist than Pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
A beauty at the season&rsquo;s close grown hectic,<br/>
    A genius who has drunk himself to death,<br/>
A rake turn&rsquo;d methodistic, or Eclectic<br/>
    (For that &rsquo;s the name they like to pray beneath)&mdash;<br/>
But most, an alderman struck apoplectic,<br/>
    Are things that really take away the breath,&mdash;<br/>
And show that late hours, wine, and love are able<br/>
To do not much less damage than the table.<br/>
<br/>
Haidee and Juan carpeted their feet<br/>
    On crimson satin, border&rsquo;d with pale blue;<br/>
Their sofa occupied three parts complete<br/>
    Of the apartment&mdash;and appear&rsquo;d quite new;<br/>
The velvet cushions (for a throne more meet)<br/>
    Were scarlet, from whose glowing centre grew<br/>
A sun emboss&rsquo;d in gold, whose rays of tissue,<br/>
Meridian-like, were seen all light to issue.<br/>
<br/>
Crystal and marble, plate and porcelain,<br/>
    Had done their work of splendour; Indian mats<br/>
And Persian carpets, which the heart bled to stain,<br/>
    Over the floors were spread; gazelles and cats,<br/>
And dwarfs and blacks, and such like things, that gain<br/>
    Their bread as ministers and favourites (that &rsquo;s<br/>
To say, by degradation) mingled there<br/>
As plentiful as in a court, or fair.<br/>
<br/>
There was no want of lofty mirrors, and<br/>
    The tables, most of ebony inlaid<br/>
With mother of pearl or ivory, stood at hand,<br/>
    Or were of tortoise-shell or rare woods made,<br/>
Fretted with gold or silver:&mdash;by command,<br/>
    The greater part of these were ready spread<br/>
With viands and sherbets in ice&mdash;and wine&mdash;<br/>
Kept for all comers at all hours to dine.<br/>
<br/>
Of all the dresses I select Haidee&rsquo;s:<br/>
    She wore two jelicks&mdash;one was of pale yellow;<br/>
Of azure, pink, and white was her chemise&mdash;<br/>
    &rsquo;Neath which her breast heaved like a little billow;<br/>
With buttons form&rsquo;d of pearls as large as peas,<br/>
    All gold and crimson shone her jelick&rsquo;s fellow,<br/>
And the striped white gauze baracan that bound her,<br/>
Like fleecy clouds about the moon, flow&rsquo;d round her.<br/>
<br/>
One large gold bracelet clasp&rsquo;d each lovely arm,<br/>
    Lockless&mdash;so pliable from the pure gold<br/>
That the hand stretch&rsquo;d and shut it without harm,<br/>
    The limb which it adorn&rsquo;d its only mould;<br/>
So beautiful&mdash;its very shape would charm;<br/>
    And, clinging as if loath to lose its hold,<br/>
The purest ore enclosed the whitest skin<br/>
That e&rsquo;er by precious metal was held in.<br/>
<br/>
Around, as princess of her father&rsquo;s land,<br/>
    A like gold bar above her instep roll&rsquo;d<br/>
Announced her rank; twelve rings were on her hand;<br/>
    Her hair was starr&rsquo;d with gems; her veil&rsquo;s fine fold<br/>
Below her breast was fasten&rsquo;d with a band<br/>
    Of lavish pearls, whose worth could scarce be told;<br/>
Her orange silk full Turkish trousers furl&rsquo;d<br/>
About the prettiest ankle in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Her hair&rsquo;s long auburn waves down to her heel<br/>
    Flow&rsquo;d like an Alpine torrent which the sun<br/>
Dyes with his morning light,&mdash;and would conceal<br/>
    Her person if allow&rsquo;d at large to run,<br/>
And still they seem resentfully to feel<br/>
    The silken fillet&rsquo;s curb, and sought to shun<br/>
Their bonds whene&rsquo;er some Zephyr caught began<br/>
To offer his young pinion as her fan.<br/>
<br/>
Round her she made an atmosphere of life,<br/>
    The very air seem&rsquo;d lighter from her eyes,<br/>
They were so soft and beautiful, and rife<br/>
    With all we can imagine of the skies,<br/>
And pure as Psyche ere she grew a wife&mdash;<br/>
    Too pure even for the purest human ties;<br/>
Her overpowering presence made you feel<br/>
It would not be idolatry to kneel.<br/>
<br/>
Her eyelashes, though dark as night, were tinged<br/>
    (It is the country&rsquo;s custom), but in vain;<br/>
For those large black eyes were so blackly fringed,<br/>
    The glossy rebels mock&rsquo;d the jetty stain,<br/>
And in their native beauty stood avenged:<br/>
    Her nails were touch&rsquo;d with henna; but again<br/>
The power of art was turn&rsquo;d to nothing, for<br/>
They could not look more rosy than before.<br/>
<br/>
The henna should be deeply dyed to make<br/>
    The skin relieved appear more fairly fair;<br/>
She had no need of this, day ne&rsquo;er will break<br/>
    On mountain tops more heavenly white than her:<br/>
The eye might doubt if it were well awake,<br/>
    She was so like a vision; I might err,<br/>
But Shakspeare also says, &rsquo;tis very silly<br/>
&lsquo;To gild refined gold, or paint the lily&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Juan had on a shawl of black and gold,<br/>
    But a white baracan, and so transparent<br/>
The sparkling gems beneath you might behold,<br/>
    Like small stars through the milky way apparent;<br/>
His turban, furl&rsquo;d in many a graceful fold,<br/>
    An emerald aigrette with Haidee&rsquo;s hair in &rsquo;t<br/>
Surmounted as its clasp&mdash;a glowing crescent,<br/>
Whose rays shone ever trembling, but incessant.<br/>
<br/>
And now they were diverted by their suite,<br/>
    Dwarfs, dancing girls, black eunuchs, and a poet,<br/>
Which made their new establishment complete;<br/>
    The last was of great fame, and liked to show it:<br/>
His verses rarely wanted their due feet;<br/>
    And for his theme&mdash;he seldom sung below it,<br/>
He being paid to satirize or flatter,<br/>
As the psalm says, &lsquo;inditing a good matter.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
He praised the present, and abused the past,<br/>
    Reversing the good custom of old days,<br/>
An Eastern anti-jacobin at last<br/>
    He turn&rsquo;d, preferring pudding to no praise&mdash;<br/>
For some few years his lot had been o&rsquo;ercast<br/>
    By his seeming independent in his lays,<br/>
But now he sung the Sultan and the Pacha<br/>
With truth like Southey, and with verse like Crashaw.<br/>
<br/>
He was a man who had seen many changes,<br/>
    And always changed as true as any needle;<br/>
His polar star being one which rather ranges,<br/>
    And not the fix&rsquo;d&mdash;he knew the way to wheedle:<br/>
So vile he &rsquo;scaped the doom which oft avenges;<br/>
    And being fluent (save indeed when fee&rsquo;d ill),<br/>
He lied with such a fervour of intention&mdash;<br/>
There was no doubt he earn&rsquo;d his laureate pension.<br/>
<br/>
But he had genius,&mdash;when a turncoat has it,<br/>
    The &lsquo;Vates irritabilis&rsquo; takes care<br/>
That without notice few full moons shall pass it;<br/>
    Even good men like to make the public stare:&mdash;<br/>
But to my subject&mdash;let me see&mdash;what was it?-<br/>
    O!&mdash;the third canto&mdash;and the pretty pair&mdash;<br/>
Their loves, and feasts, and house, and dress, and mode<br/>
Of living in their insular abode.<br/>
<br/>
Their poet, a sad trimmer, but no less<br/>
    In company a very pleasant fellow,<br/>
Had been the favourite of full many a mess<br/>
    Of men, and made them speeches when half mellow;<br/>
And though his meaning they could rarely guess,<br/>
    Yet still they deign&rsquo;d to hiccup or to bellow<br/>
The glorious meed of popular applause,<br/>
Of which the first ne&rsquo;er knows the second cause.<br/>
<br/>
But now being lifted into high society,<br/>
    And having pick&rsquo;d up several odds and ends<br/>
Of free thoughts in his travels for variety,<br/>
    He deem&rsquo;d, being in a lone isle, among friends,<br/>
That, without any danger of a riot, he<br/>
    Might for long lying make himself amends;<br/>
And, singing as he sung in his warm youth,<br/>
Agree to a short armistice with truth.<br/>
<br/>
He had travell&rsquo;d &rsquo;mongst the Arabs, Turks, and Franks,<br/>
    And knew the self-loves of the different nations;<br/>
And having lived with people of all ranks,<br/>
    Had something ready upon most occasions&mdash;<br/>
Which got him a few presents and some thanks.<br/>
    He varied with some skill his adulations;<br/>
To &lsquo;do at Rome as Romans do,&rsquo; a piece<br/>
Of conduct was which he observed in Greece.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, usually, when he was ask&rsquo;d to sing,<br/>
    He gave the different nations something national;<br/>
&rsquo;Twas all the same to him&mdash;&lsquo;God save the king,&rsquo;<br/>
    Or &lsquo;Ca ira,&rsquo; according to the fashion all:<br/>
His muse made increment of any thing,<br/>
    From the high lyric down to the low rational:<br/>
If Pindar sang horse-races, what should hinder<br/>
Himself from being as pliable as Pindar?<br/>
<br/>
In France, for instance, he would write a chanson;<br/>
    In England a six canto quarto tale;<br/>
In Spain, he&rsquo;d make a ballad or romance on<br/>
    The last war&mdash;much the same in Portugal;<br/>
In Germany, the Pegasus he&rsquo;d prance on<br/>
    Would be old Goethe&rsquo;s (see what says De Stael);<br/>
In Italy he&rsquo;d ape the &lsquo;Trecentisti;&rsquo;<br/>
In Greece, he sing some sort of hymn like this t&rsquo; ye:<br/>
<br/>
The isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece!<br/>
     Where burning Sappho loved and sung,<br/>
Where grew the arts of war and peace,<br/>
     Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!<br/>
Eternal summer gilds them yet,<br/>
But all, except their sun, is set.<br/>
<br/>
The Scian and the Teian muse,<br/>
     The hero&rsquo;s harp, the lover&rsquo;s lute,<br/>
Have found the fame your shores refuse;<br/>
     Their place of birth alone is mute<br/>
To sounds which echo further west<br/>
Than your sires&rsquo; &lsquo;Islands of the Blest.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
The mountains look on Marathon&mdash;<br/>
     And Marathon looks on the sea;<br/>
And musing there an hour alone,<br/>
     I dream&rsquo;d that Greece might still be free;<br/>
For standing on the Persians&rsquo; grave,<br/>
I could not deem myself a slave.<br/>
<br/>
A king sate on the rocky brow<br/>
     Which looks o&rsquo;er sea-born Salamis;<br/>
And ships, by thousands, lay below,<br/>
     And men in nations;&mdash;all were his!<br/>
He counted them at break of day&mdash;<br/>
And when the sun set where were they?<br/>
<br/>
And where are they? and where art thou,<br/>
     My country? On thy voiceless shore<br/>
The heroic lay is tuneless now&mdash;<br/>
     The heroic bosom beats no more!<br/>
And must thy lyre, so long divine,<br/>
Degenerate into hands like mine?<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis something, in the dearth of fame,<br/>
     Though link&rsquo;d among a fetter&rsquo;d race,<br/>
To feel at least a patriot&rsquo;s shame,<br/>
     Even as I sing, suffuse my face;<br/>
For what is left the poet here?<br/>
For Greeks a blush&mdash;for Greece a tear.<br/>
<br/>
Must we but weep o&rsquo;er days more blest?<br/>
     Must we but blush?&mdash;Our fathers bled.<br/>
Earth! render back from out thy breast<br/>
     A remnant of our Spartan dead!<br/>
Of the three hundred grant but three,<br/>
To make a new Thermopylae!<br/>
<br/>
What, silent still? and silent all?<br/>
     Ah! no;&mdash;the voices of the dead<br/>
Sound like a distant torrent&rsquo;s fall,<br/>
     And answer, &lsquo;Let one living head,<br/>
But one arise,&mdash;we come, we come!&rsquo;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis but the living who are dumb.<br/>
<br/>
In vain&mdash;in vain: strike other chords;<br/>
     Fill high the cup with Samian wine!<br/>
Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,<br/>
     And shed the blood of Scio&rsquo;s vine!<br/>
Hark! rising to the ignoble call&mdash;<br/>
How answers each bold Bacchanal!<br/>
<br/>
You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet,<br/>
     Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?<br/>
Of two such lessons, why forget<br/>
     The nobler and the manlier one?<br/>
You have the letters Cadmus gave&mdash;<br/>
Think ye he meant them for a slave?<br/>
<br/>
Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!<br/>
     We will not think of themes like these!<br/>
It made Anacreon&rsquo;s song divine:<br/>
     He served&mdash;but served Polycrates&mdash;<br/>
A tyrant; but our masters then<br/>
Were still, at least, our countrymen.<br/>
<br/>
The tyrant of the Chersonese<br/>
     Was freedom&rsquo;s best and bravest friend;<br/>
That tyrant was Miltiades!<br/>
     O! that the present hour would lend<br/>
Another despot of the kind!<br/>
Such chains as his were sure to bind.<br/>
<br/>
Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!<br/>
     On Suli&rsquo;s rock, and Parga&rsquo;s shore,<br/>
Exists the remnant of a line<br/>
     Such as the Doric mothers bore;<br/>
And there, perhaps, some seed is sown,<br/>
The Heracleidan blood might own.<br/>
<br/>
Trust not for freedom to the Franks&mdash;<br/>
     They have a king who buys and sells;<br/>
In native swords, and native ranks,<br/>
     The only hope of courage dwells;<br/>
But Turkish force, and Latin fraud,<br/>
Would break your shield, however broad.<br/>
<br/>
Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!<br/>
     Our virgins dance beneath the shade&mdash;<br/>
I see their glorious black eyes shine;<br/>
     But gazing on each glowing maid,<br/>
My own the burning tear-drop laves,<br/>
To think such breasts must suckle slaves<br/>
<br/>
Place me on Sunium&rsquo;s marbled steep,<br/>
     Where nothing, save the waves and I,<br/>
May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;<br/>
     There, swan-like, let me sing and die:<br/>
A land of slaves shall ne&rsquo;er be mine&mdash;<br/>
Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!<br/>
<br/>
Thus sung, or would, or could, or should have sung,<br/>
    The modern Greek, in tolerable verse;<br/>
If not like Orpheus quite, when Greece was young,<br/>
    Yet in these times he might have done much worse:<br/>
His strain display&rsquo;d some feeling&mdash;right or wrong;<br/>
    And feeling, in a poet, is the source<br/>
Of others&rsquo; feeling; but they are such liars,<br/>
And take all colours&mdash;like the hands of dyers.<br/>
<br/>
But words are things, and a small drop of ink,<br/>
    Falling like dew, upon a thought, produces<br/>
That which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think;<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis strange, the shortest letter which man uses<br/>
Instead of speech, may form a lasting link<br/>
    Of ages; to what straits old Time reduces<br/>
Frail man, when paper&mdash;even a rag like this,<br/>
Survives himself, his tomb, and all that &rsquo;s his.<br/>
<br/>
And when his bones are dust, his grave a blank,<br/>
    His station, generation, even his nation,<br/>
Become a thing, or nothing, save to rank<br/>
    In chronological commemoration,<br/>
Some dull MS. oblivion long has sank,<br/>
    Or graven stone found in a barrack&rsquo;s station<br/>
In digging the foundation of a closet,<br/>
May turn his name up, as a rare deposit.<br/>
<br/>
And glory long has made the sages smile;<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis something, nothing, words, illusion, wind&mdash;<br/>
Depending more upon the historian&rsquo;s style<br/>
    Than on the name a person leaves behind:<br/>
Troy owes to Homer what whist owes to Hoyle:<br/>
    The present century was growing blind<br/>
To the great Marlborough&rsquo;s skill in giving knocks,<br/>
Until his late life by Archdeacon Coxe.<br/>
<br/>
Milton &rsquo;s the prince of poets&mdash;so we say;<br/>
    A little heavy, but no less divine:<br/>
An independent being in his day&mdash;<br/>
    Learn&rsquo;d, pious, temperate in love and wine;<br/>
But, his life falling into Johnson&rsquo;s way,<br/>
    We&rsquo;re told this great high priest of all the Nine<br/>
Was whipt at college&mdash;a harsh sire&mdash;odd spouse,<br/>
For the first Mrs. Milton left his house.<br/>
<br/>
All these are, certes, entertaining facts,<br/>
    Like Shakspeare&rsquo;s stealing deer, Lord Bacon&rsquo;s bribes;<br/>
Like Titus&rsquo; youth, and Caesar&rsquo;s earliest acts;<br/>
    Like Burns (whom Doctor Currie well describes);<br/>
Like Cromwell&rsquo;s pranks;&mdash;but although truth exacts<br/>
    These amiable descriptions from the scribes,<br/>
As most essential to their hero&rsquo;s story,<br/>
They do not much contribute to his glory.<br/>
<br/>
All are not moralists, like Southey, when<br/>
    He prated to the world of &lsquo;Pantisocracy;&rsquo;<br/>
Or Wordsworth unexcised, unhired, who then<br/>
    Season&rsquo;d his pedlar poems with democracy;<br/>
Or Coleridge, long before his flighty pen<br/>
    Let to the Morning Post its aristocracy;<br/>
When he and Southey, following the same path,<br/>
Espoused two partners (milliners of Bath).<br/>
<br/>
Such names at present cut a convict figure,<br/>
    The very Botany Bay in moral geography;<br/>
Their loyal treason, renegado rigour,<br/>
    Are good manure for their more bare biography.<br/>
Wordsworth&rsquo;s last quarto, by the way, is bigger<br/>
    Than any since the birthday of typography;<br/>
A drowsy frowzy poem, call&rsquo;d the &lsquo;Excursion.&rsquo;<br/>
Writ in a manner which is my aversion.<br/>
<br/>
He there builds up a formidable dyke<br/>
    Between his own and others&rsquo; intellect;<br/>
But Wordsworth&rsquo;s poem, and his followers, like<br/>
    Joanna Southcote&rsquo;s Shiloh, and her sect,<br/>
Are things which in this century don&rsquo;t strike<br/>
    The public mind,&mdash;so few are the elect;<br/>
And the new births of both their stale virginities<br/>
Have proved but dropsies, taken for divinities.<br/>
<br/>
But let me to my story: I must own,<br/>
    If I have any fault, it is digression&mdash;<br/>
Leaving my people to proceed alone,<br/>
    While I soliloquize beyond expression;<br/>
But these are my addresses from the throne,<br/>
    Which put off business to the ensuing session:<br/>
Forgetting each omission is a loss to<br/>
The world, not quite so great as Ariosto.<br/>
<br/>
I know that what our neighbours call &lsquo;longueurs&rsquo;<br/>
    (We&rsquo;ve not so good a word, but have the thing<br/>
In that complete perfection which ensures<br/>
    An epic from Bob Southey every spring),<br/>
Form not the true temptation which allures<br/>
    The reader; but &rsquo;twould not be hard to bring<br/>
Some fine examples of the epopee,<br/>
To prove its grand ingredient is ennui.<br/>
<br/>
We learn from Horace, &lsquo;Homer sometimes sleeps;&rsquo;<br/>
    We feel without him, Wordsworth sometimes wakes,&mdash;<br/>
To show with what complacency he creeps,<br/>
    With his dear &lsquo;Waggoners,&rsquo; around his lakes.<br/>
He wishes for &lsquo;a boat&rsquo; to sail the deeps&mdash;<br/>
    Of ocean?&mdash;No, of air; and then he makes<br/>
Another outcry for &lsquo;a little boat,&rsquo;<br/>
And drivels seas to set it well afloat.<br/>
<br/>
If he must fain sweep o&rsquo;er the ethereal plain,<br/>
    And Pegasus runs restive in his &lsquo;Waggon,&rsquo;<br/>
Could he not beg the loan of Charles&rsquo;s Wain?<br/>
    Or pray Medea for a single dragon?<br/>
Or if, too classic for his vulgar brain,<br/>
    He fear&rsquo;d his neck to venture such a nag on,<br/>
And he must needs mount nearer to the moon,<br/>
Could not the blockhead ask for a balloon?<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Pedlars,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Boats,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Waggons!&rsquo; Oh! ye shades<br/>
    Of Pope and Dryden, are we come to this?<br/>
That trash of such sort not alone evades<br/>
    Contempt, but from the bathos&rsquo; vast abyss<br/>
Floats scumlike uppermost, and these Jack Cades<br/>
    Of sense and song above your graves may hiss&mdash;<br/>
The&rsquo;little boatman&rsquo; and his &lsquo;Peter Bell&rsquo;<br/>
Can sneer at him who drew &lsquo;Achitophel&rsquo;!<br/>
<br/>
T&rsquo; our tale.&mdash;The feast was over, the slaves gone,<br/>
    The dwarfs and dancing girls had all retired;<br/>
The Arab lore and poet&rsquo;s song were done,<br/>
    And every sound of revelry expired;<br/>
The lady and her lover, left alone,<br/>
    The rosy flood of twilight&rsquo;s sky admired;&mdash;<br/>
Ave Maria! o&rsquo;er the earth and sea,<br/>
That heavenliest hour of Heaven is worthiest thee!<br/>
<br/>
Ave Maria! blessed be the hour!<br/>
    The time, the clime, the spot, where I so oft<br/>
Have felt that moment in its fullest power<br/>
    Sink o&rsquo;er the earth so beautiful and soft,<br/>
While swung the deep bell in the distant tower,<br/>
    Or the faint dying day-hymn stole aloft,<br/>
And not a breath crept through the rosy air,<br/>
And yet the forest leaves seem&rsquo;d stirr&rsquo;d with prayer.<br/>
<br/>
Ave Maria! &rsquo;tis the hour of prayer!<br/>
    Ave Maria! &rsquo;tis the hour of love!<br/>
Ave Maria! may our spirits dare<br/>
    Look up to thine and to thy Son&rsquo;s above!<br/>
Ave Maria! oh that face so fair!<br/>
    Those downcast eyes beneath the Almighty dove&mdash;<br/>
What though &rsquo;tis but a pictured image?&mdash;strike&mdash;<br/>
That painting is no idol,&mdash;&rsquo;tis too like.<br/>
<br/>
Some kinder casuists are pleased to say,<br/>
    In nameless print&mdash;that I have no devotion;<br/>
But set those persons down with me to pray,<br/>
    And you shall see who has the properest notion<br/>
Of getting into heaven the shortest way;<br/>
    My altars are the mountains and the ocean,<br/>
Earth, air, stars,&mdash;all that springs from the great Whole,<br/>
Who hath produced, and will receive the soul.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet hour of twilight!&mdash;in the solitude<br/>
    Of the pine forest, and the silent shore<br/>
Which bounds Ravenna&rsquo;s immemorial wood,<br/>
    Rooted where once the Adrian wave flow&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er,<br/>
To where the last Caesarean fortress stood,<br/>
    Evergreen forest! which Boccaccio&rsquo;s lore<br/>
And Dryden&rsquo;s lay made haunted ground to me,<br/>
How have I loved the twilight hour and thee!<br/>
<br/>
The shrill cicadas, people of the pine,<br/>
    Making their summer lives one ceaseless song,<br/>
Were the sole echoes, save my steed&rsquo;s and mine,<br/>
    And vesper bell&rsquo;s that rose the boughs along;<br/>
The spectre huntsman of Onesti&rsquo;s line,<br/>
    His hell-dogs, and their chase, and the fair throng<br/>
Which learn&rsquo;d from this example not to fly<br/>
From a true lover,&mdash;shadow&rsquo;d my mind&rsquo;s eye.<br/>
<br/>
O, Hesperus! thou bringest all good things&mdash;<br/>
    Home to the weary, to the hungry cheer,<br/>
To the young bird the parent&rsquo;s brooding wings,<br/>
    The welcome stall to the o&rsquo;erlabour&rsquo;d steer;<br/>
Whate&rsquo;er of peace about our hearthstone clings,<br/>
    Whate&rsquo;er our household gods protect of dear,<br/>
Are gather&rsquo;d round us by thy look of rest;<br/>
Thou bring&rsquo;st the child, too, to the mother&rsquo;s breast.<br/>
<br/>
Soft hour! which wakes the wish and melts the heart<br/>
    Of those who sail the seas, on the first day<br/>
When they from their sweet friends are torn apart;<br/>
    Or fills with love the pilgrim on his way<br/>
As the far bell of vesper makes him start,<br/>
    Seeming to weep the dying day&rsquo;s decay;<br/>
Is this a fancy which our reason scorns?<br/>
Ah! surely nothing dies but something mourns!<br/>
<br/>
When Nero perish&rsquo;d by the justest doom<br/>
    Which ever the destroyer yet destroy&rsquo;d,<br/>
Amidst the roar of liberated Rome,<br/>
    Of nations freed, and the world overjoy&rsquo;d,<br/>
Some hands unseen strew&rsquo;d flowers upon his tomb:<br/>
    Perhaps the weakness of a heart not void<br/>
Of feeling for some kindness done, when power<br/>
Had left the wretch an uncorrupted hour.<br/>
<br/>
But I&rsquo;m digressing; what on earth has Nero,<br/>
    Or any such like sovereign buffoons,<br/>
To do with the transactions of my hero,<br/>
    More than such madmen&rsquo;s fellow man&mdash;the moon&rsquo;s?<br/>
Sure my invention must be down at zero,<br/>
    And I grown one of many &lsquo;wooden spoons&rsquo;<br/>
Of verse (the name with which we Cantabs please<br/>
To dub the last of honours in degrees).<br/>
<br/>
I feel this tediousness will never do&mdash;<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis being too epic, and I must cut down<br/>
(In copying) this long canto into two;<br/>
    They&rsquo;ll never find it out, unless I own<br/>
The fact, excepting some experienced few;<br/>
    And then as an improvement &rsquo;twill be shown:<br/>
I&rsquo;ll prove that such the opinion of the critic is<br/>
From Aristotle passim.&mdash;See poietikes.<br/>

<h2><a name="2H_4_0005"></a>
CANTO THE FOURTH.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
Nothing so difficult as a beginning<br/>
    In poesy, unless perhaps the end;<br/>
For oftentimes when Pegasus seems winning<br/>
    The race, he sprains a wing, and down we tend,<br/>
Like Lucifer when hurl&rsquo;d from heaven for sinning;<br/>
    Our sin the same, and hard as his to mend,<br/>
Being pride, which leads the mind to soar too far,<br/>
Till our own weakness shows us what we are.<br/>
<br/>
But Time, which brings all beings to their level,<br/>
    And sharp Adversity, will teach at last<br/>
Man,&mdash;and, as we would hope,&mdash;perhaps the devil,<br/>
    That neither of their intellects are vast:<br/>
While youth&rsquo;s hot wishes in our red veins revel,<br/>
    We know not this&mdash;the blood flows on too fast;<br/>
But as the torrent widens towards the ocean,<br/>
We ponder deeply on each past emotion.<br/>
<br/>
As boy, I thought myself a clever fellow,<br/>
    And wish&rsquo;d that others held the same opinion;<br/>
They took it up when my days grew more mellow,<br/>
    And other minds acknowledged my dominion:<br/>
Now my sere fancy &lsquo;falls into the yellow<br/>
    Leaf,&rsquo; and Imagination droops her pinion,<br/>
And the sad truth which hovers o&rsquo;er my desk<br/>
Turns what was once romantic to burlesque.<br/>
<br/>
And if I laugh at any mortal thing,<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis that I may not weep; and if I weep,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis that our nature cannot always bring<br/>
    Itself to apathy, for we must steep<br/>
Our hearts first in the depths of Lethe&rsquo;s spring,<br/>
    Ere what we least wish to behold will sleep:<br/>
Thetis baptized her mortal son in Styx;<br/>
A mortal mother would on Lethe fix.<br/>
<br/>
Some have accused me of a strange design<br/>
    Against the creed and morals of the land,<br/>
And trace it in this poem every line:<br/>
    I don&rsquo;t pretend that I quite understand<br/>
My own meaning when I would be very fine;<br/>
    But the fact is that I have nothing plann&rsquo;d,<br/>
Unless it were to be a moment merry,<br/>
A novel word in my vocabulary.<br/>
<br/>
To the kind reader of our sober clime<br/>
    This way of writing will appear exotic;<br/>
Pulci was sire of the half-serious rhyme,<br/>
    Who sang when chivalry was more Quixotic,<br/>
And revell&rsquo;d in the fancies of the time,<br/>
    True knights, chaste dames, huge giants, kings despotic:<br/>
But all these, save the last, being obsolete,<br/>
I chose a modern subject as more meet.<br/>
<br/>
How I have treated it, I do not know;<br/>
    Perhaps no better than they have treated me<br/>
Who have imputed such designs as show<br/>
    Not what they saw, but what they wish&rsquo;d to see:<br/>
But if it gives them pleasure, be it so;<br/>
    This is a liberal age, and thoughts are free:<br/>
Meantime Apollo plucks me by the ear,<br/>
And tells me to resume my story here.<br/>
<br/>
Young Juan and his lady-love were left<br/>
    To their own hearts&rsquo; most sweet society;<br/>
Even Time the pitiless in sorrow cleft<br/>
    With his rude scythe such gentle bosoms; he<br/>
Sigh&rsquo;d to behold them of their hours bereft,<br/>
    Though foe to love; and yet they could not be<br/>
Meant to grow old, but die in happy spring,<br/>
Before one charm or hope had taken wing.<br/>
<br/>
Their faces were not made for wrinkles, their<br/>
    Pure blood to stagnate, their great hearts to fail;<br/>
The blank grey was not made to blast their hair,<br/>
    But like the climes that know nor snow nor hail<br/>
They were all summer: lightning might assail<br/>
    And shiver them to ashes, but to trail<br/>
A long and snake-like life of dull decay<br/>
Was not for them&mdash;they had too little day.<br/>
<br/>
They were alone once more; for them to be<br/>
    Thus was another Eden; they were never<br/>
Weary, unless when separate: the tree<br/>
    Cut from its forest root of years&mdash;the river<br/>
Damm&rsquo;d from its fountain&mdash;the child from the knee<br/>
    And breast maternal wean&rsquo;d at once for ever,&mdash;<br/>
Would wither less than these two torn apart;<br/>
Alas! there is no instinct like the heart&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
The heart&mdash;which may be broken: happy they!<br/>
    Thrice fortunate! who of that fragile mould,<br/>
The precious porcelain of human clay,<br/>
    Break with the first fall: they can ne&rsquo;er behold<br/>
The long year link&rsquo;d with heavy day on day,<br/>
    And all which must be borne, and never told;<br/>
While life&rsquo;s strange principle will often lie<br/>
Deepest in those who long the most to die.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Whom the gods love die young,&rsquo; was said of yore,<br/>
    And many deaths do they escape by this:<br/>
The death of friends, and that which slays even more&mdash;<br/>
    The death of friendship, love, youth, all that is,<br/>
Except mere breath; and since the silent shore<br/>
    Awaits at last even those who longest miss<br/>
The old archer&rsquo;s shafts, perhaps the early grave<br/>
Which men weep over may be meant to save.<br/>
<br/>
Haidee and Juan thought not of the dead&mdash;<br/>
    The heavens, and earth, and air, seem&rsquo;d made for them:<br/>
They found no fault with Time, save that he fled;<br/>
    They saw not in themselves aught to condemn:<br/>
Each was the other&rsquo;s mirror, and but read<br/>
    Joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem,<br/>
And knew such brightness was but the reflection<br/>
Of their exchanging glances of affection.<br/>
<br/>
The gentle pressure, and the thrilling touch,<br/>
    The least glance better understood than words,<br/>
Which still said all, and ne&rsquo;er could say too much;<br/>
    A language, too, but like to that of birds,<br/>
Known but to them, at least appearing such<br/>
    As but to lovers a true sense affords;<br/>
Sweet playful phrases, which would seem absurd<br/>
To those who have ceased to hear such, or ne&rsquo;er heard,&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
All these were theirs, for they were children still,<br/>
    And children still they should have ever been;<br/>
They were not made in the real world to fill<br/>
    A busy character in the dull scene,<br/>
But like two beings born from out a rill,<br/>
    A nymph and her beloved, all unseen<br/>
To pass their lives in fountains and on flowers,<br/>
And never know the weight of human hours.<br/>
<br/>
Moons changing had roll&rsquo;d on, and changeless found<br/>
    Those their bright rise had lighted to such joys<br/>
As rarely they beheld throughout their round;<br/>
    And these were not of the vain kind which cloys,<br/>
For theirs were buoyant spirits, never bound<br/>
    By the mere senses; and that which destroys<br/>
Most love, possession, unto them appear&rsquo;d<br/>
A thing which each endearment more endear&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
O beautiful! and rare as beautiful<br/>
    But theirs was love in which the mind delights<br/>
To lose itself when the old world grows dull,<br/>
    And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,<br/>
Intrigues, adventures of the common school,<br/>
    Its petty passions, marriages, and flights,<br/>
Where Hymen&rsquo;s torch but brands one strumpet more,<br/>
Whose husband only knows her not a wh&mdash;re.<br/>
<br/>
Hard words; harsh truth; a truth which many know.<br/>
    Enough.&mdash;The faithful and the fairy pair,<br/>
Who never found a single hour too slow,<br/>
    What was it made them thus exempt from care?<br/>
Young innate feelings all have felt below,<br/>
    Which perish in the rest, but in them were<br/>
Inherent&mdash;what we mortals call romantic,<br/>
And always envy, though we deem it frantic.<br/>
<br/>
This is in others a factitious state,<br/>
    An opium dream of too much youth and reading,<br/>
But was in them their nature or their fate:<br/>
    No novels e&rsquo;er had set their young hearts bleeding,<br/>
For Haidee&rsquo;s knowledge was by no means great,<br/>
    And Juan was a boy of saintly breeding;<br/>
So that there was no reason for their loves<br/>
More than for those of nightingales or doves.<br/>
<br/>
They gazed upon the sunset; &rsquo;tis an hour<br/>
    Dear unto all, but dearest to their eyes,<br/>
For it had made them what they were: the power<br/>
    Of love had first o&rsquo;erwhelm&rsquo;d them from such skies,<br/>
When happiness had been their only dower,<br/>
    And twilight saw them link&rsquo;d in passion&rsquo;s ties;<br/>
Charm&rsquo;d with each other, all things charm&rsquo;d that brought<br/>
The past still welcome as the present thought.<br/>
<br/>
I know not why, but in that hour to-night,<br/>
    Even as they gazed, a sudden tremor came,<br/>
And swept, as &rsquo;twere, across their hearts&rsquo; delight,<br/>
    Like the wind o&rsquo;er a harp-string, or a flame,<br/>
When one is shook in sound, and one in sight;<br/>
    And thus some boding flash&rsquo;d through either frame,<br/>
And call&rsquo;d from Juan&rsquo;s breast a faint low sigh,<br/>
While one new tear arose in Haidee&rsquo;s eye.<br/>
<br/>
That large black prophet eye seem&rsquo;d to dilate<br/>
    And follow far the disappearing sun,<br/>
As if their last day! of a happy date<br/>
    With his broad, bright, and dropping orb were gone;<br/>
Juan gazed on her as to ask his fate&mdash;<br/>
    He felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,<br/>
His glance inquired of hers for some excuse<br/>
For feelings causeless, or at least abstruse.<br/>
<br/>
She turn&rsquo;d to him, and smiled, but in that sort<br/>
    Which makes not others smile; then turn&rsquo;d aside:<br/>
Whatever feeling shook her, it seem&rsquo;d short,<br/>
    And master&rsquo;d by her wisdom or her pride;<br/>
When Juan spoke, too&mdash;it might be in sport&mdash;<br/>
    Of this their mutual feeling, she replied&mdash;<br/>
&lsquo;If it should be so,&mdash;but&mdash;it cannot be&mdash;<br/>
Or I at least shall not survive to see.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Juan would question further, but she press&rsquo;d<br/>
    His lip to hers, and silenced him with this,<br/>
And then dismiss&rsquo;d the omen from her breast,<br/>
    Defying augury with that fond kiss;<br/>
And no doubt of all methods &rsquo;tis the best:<br/>
    Some people prefer wine&mdash;&rsquo;tis not amiss;<br/>
I have tried both; so those who would a part take<br/>
May choose between the headache and the heartache.<br/>
<br/>
One of the two, according to your choice,<br/>
    Woman or wine, you&rsquo;ll have to undergo;<br/>
Both maladies are taxes on our joys:<br/>
    But which to choose, I really hardly know;<br/>
And if I had to give a casting voice,<br/>
    For both sides I could many reasons show,<br/>
And then decide, without great wrong to either,<br/>
It were much better to have both than neither.<br/>
<br/>
Juan and Haidee gazed upon each other<br/>
    With swimming looks of speechless tenderness,<br/>
Which mix&rsquo;d all feelings, friend, child, lover, brother,<br/>
    All that the best can mingle and express<br/>
When two pure hearts are pour&rsquo;d in one another,<br/>
    And love too much, and yet can not love less;<br/>
But almost sanctify the sweet excess<br/>
By the immortal wish and power to bless.<br/>
<br/>
Mix&rsquo;d in each other&rsquo;s arms, and heart in heart,<br/>
    Why did they not then die?&mdash;they had lived too long<br/>
Should an hour come to bid them breathe apart;<br/>
    Years could but bring them cruel things or wrong;<br/>
The world was not for them, nor the world&rsquo;s art<br/>
    For beings passionate as Sappho&rsquo;s song;<br/>
Love was born with them, in them, so intense,<br/>
It was their very spirit&mdash;not a sense.<br/>
<br/>
They should have lived together deep in woods,<br/>
    Unseen as sings the nightingale; they were<br/>
Unfit to mix in these thick solitudes<br/>
    Call&rsquo;d social, haunts of Hate, and Vice, and Care:<br/>
How lonely every freeborn creature broods!<br/>
    The sweetest song-birds nestle in a pair;<br/>
The eagle soars alone; the gull and crow<br/>
Flock o&rsquo;er their carrion, just like men below.<br/>
<br/>
Now pillow&rsquo;d cheek to cheek, in loving sleep,<br/>
    Haidee and Juan their siesta took,<br/>
A gentle slumber, but it was not deep,<br/>
    For ever and anon a something shook<br/>
Juan, and shuddering o&rsquo;er his frame would creep;<br/>
    And Haidee&rsquo;s sweet lips murmur&rsquo;d like a brook<br/>
A wordless music, and her face so fair<br/>
Stirr&rsquo;d with her dream, as rose-leaves with the air.<br/>
<br/>
Or as the stirring of a deep dear stream<br/>
    Within an Alpine hollow, when the wind<br/>
Walks o&rsquo;er it, was she shaken by the dream,<br/>
    The mystical usurper of the mind&mdash;<br/>
O&rsquo;erpowering us to be whate&rsquo;er may seem<br/>
    Good to the soul which we no more can bind;<br/>
Strange state of being! (for &rsquo;tis still to be)<br/>
Senseless to feel, and with seal&rsquo;d eyes to see.<br/>
<br/>
She dream&rsquo;d of being alone on the sea-shore,<br/>
    Chain&rsquo;d to a rock; she knew not how, but stir<br/>
She could not from the spot, and the loud roar<br/>
    Grew, and each wave rose roughly, threatening her;<br/>
And o&rsquo;er her upper lip they seem&rsquo;d to pour,<br/>
    Until she sobb&rsquo;d for breath, and soon they were<br/>
Foaming o&rsquo;er her lone head, so fierce and high&mdash;<br/>
Each broke to drown her, yet she could not die.<br/>
<br/>
Anon&mdash;she was released, and then she stray&rsquo;d<br/>
    O&rsquo;er the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet,<br/>
And stumbled almost every step she made;<br/>
    And something roll&rsquo;d before her in a sheet,<br/>
Which she must still pursue howe&rsquo;er afraid:<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas white and indistinct, nor stopp&rsquo;d to meet<br/>
Her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed, and grasp&rsquo;d,<br/>
And ran, but it escaped her as she clasp&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
The dream changed:&mdash;in a cave she stood, its walls<br/>
    Were hung with marble icicles, the work<br/>
Of ages on its water-fretted halls,<br/>
    Where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk;<br/>
Her hair was dripping, and the very balls<br/>
    Of her black eyes seem&rsquo;d turn&rsquo;d to tears, and mirk<br/>
The sharp rocks look&rsquo;d below each drop they caught,<br/>
Which froze to marble as it fell,&mdash;she thought.<br/>
<br/>
And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,<br/>
    Pale as the foam that froth&rsquo;d on his dead brow,<br/>
Which she essay&rsquo;d in vain to clear (how sweet<br/>
    Were once her cares, how idle seem&rsquo;d they now!),<br/>
Lay Juan, nor could aught renew the beat<br/>
    Of his quench&rsquo;d heart; and the sea dirges low<br/>
Rang in her sad ears like a mermaid&rsquo;s song,<br/>
And that brief dream appear&rsquo;d a life too long.<br/>
<br/>
And gazing on the dead, she thought his face<br/>
    Faded, or alter&rsquo;d into something new&mdash;<br/>
Like to her father&rsquo;s features, till each trace&mdash;<br/>
    More like and like to Lambro&rsquo;s aspect grew&mdash;<br/>
With all his keen worn look and Grecian grace;<br/>
    And starting, she awoke, and what to view?<br/>
O! Powers of Heaven! what dark eye meets she there?<br/>
&rsquo;Tis&mdash;&rsquo;tis her father&rsquo;s&mdash;fix&rsquo;d upon the pair!<br/>
<br/>
Then shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,<br/>
    With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see<br/>
Him whom she deem&rsquo;d a habitant where dwell<br/>
    The ocean-buried, risen from death, to be<br/>
Perchance the death of one she loved too well:<br/>
    Dear as her father had been to Haidee,<br/>
It was a moment of that awful kind&mdash;<br/>
I have seen such&mdash;but must not call to mind.<br/>
<br/>
Up Juan sprung to Haidee&rsquo;s bitter shriek,<br/>
    And caught her falling, and from off the wall<br/>
Snatch&rsquo;d down his sabre, in hot haste to wreak<br/>
    Vengeance on him who was the cause of all:<br/>
Then Lambro, who till now forbore to speak,<br/>
    Smiled scornfully, and said, &lsquo;Within my call,<br/>
A thousand scimitars await the word;<br/>
Put up, young man, put up your silly sword.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
And Haidee clung around him; &lsquo;Juan, &rsquo;tis&mdash;<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis Lambro&mdash;&rsquo;tis my father! Kneel with me&mdash;<br/>
He will forgive us&mdash;yes&mdash;it must be&mdash;yes.<br/>
    O! dearest father, in this agony<br/>
Of pleasure and of pain&mdash;even while I kiss<br/>
    Thy garment&rsquo;s hem with transport, can it be<br/>
That doubt should mingle with my filial joy?<br/>
Deal with me as thou wilt, but spare this boy.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
High and inscrutable the old man stood,<br/>
    Calm in his voice, and calm within his eye&mdash;<br/>
Not always signs with him of calmest mood:<br/>
    He look&rsquo;d upon her, but gave no reply;<br/>
Then turn&rsquo;d to Juan, in whose cheek the blood<br/>
    Oft came and went, as there resolved to die;<br/>
In arms, at least, he stood, in act to spring<br/>
On the first foe whom Lambro&rsquo;s call might bring.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Young man, your sword;&rsquo; so Lambro once more said:<br/>
    Juan replied, &lsquo;Not while this arm is free.&rsquo;<br/>
The old man&rsquo;s cheek grew pale, but not with dread,<br/>
    And drawing from his belt a pistol, he<br/>
Replied, &lsquo;Your blood be then on your own head.&rsquo;<br/>
    Then look&rsquo;d dose at the flint, as if to see<br/>
&rsquo;Twas fresh&mdash;for he had lately used the lock&mdash;<br/>
And next proceeded quietly to cock.<br/>
<br/>
It has a strange quick jar upon the ear,<br/>
    That cocking of a pistol, when you know<br/>
A moment more will bring the sight to bear<br/>
    Upon your person, twelve yards off, or so;<br/>
A gentlemanly distance, not too near,<br/>
    If you have got a former friend for foe;<br/>
But after being fired at once or twice,<br/>
The ear becomes more Irish, and less nice.<br/>
<br/>
Lambro presented, and one instant more<br/>
    Had stopp&rsquo;d this Canto, and Don Juan&rsquo;s breath,<br/>
When Haidee threw herself her boy before;<br/>
    Stern as her sire: &lsquo;On me,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;let death<br/>
Descend&mdash;the fault is mine; this fatal shore<br/>
    He found&mdash;but sought not. I have pledged my faith;<br/>
I love him&mdash;I will die with him: I knew<br/>
Your nature&rsquo;s firmness&mdash;know your daughter&rsquo;s too.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
A minute past, and she had been all tears,<br/>
    And tenderness, and infancy; but now<br/>
She stood as one who champion&rsquo;d human fears&mdash;<br/>
    Pale, statue-like, and stern, she woo&rsquo;d the blow;<br/>
And tall beyond her sex, and their compeers,<br/>
    She drew up to her height, as if to show<br/>
A fairer mark; and with a fix&rsquo;d eye scann&rsquo;d<br/>
Her father&rsquo;s face&mdash;but never stopp&rsquo;d his hand.<br/>
<br/>
He gazed on her, and she on him; &rsquo;twas strange<br/>
    How like they look&rsquo;d! the expression was the same;<br/>
Serenely savage, with a little change<br/>
    In the large dark eye&rsquo;s mutual-darted flame;<br/>
For she, too, was as one who could avenge,<br/>
    If cause should be&mdash;a lioness, though tame.<br/>
Her father&rsquo;s blood before her father&rsquo;s face<br/>
Boil&rsquo;d up, and proved her truly of his race.<br/>
<br/>
I said they were alike, their features and<br/>
    Their stature, differing but in sex and years;<br/>
Even to the delicacy of their hand<br/>
    There was resemblance, such as true blood wears;<br/>
And now to see them, thus divided, stand<br/>
    In fix&rsquo;d ferocity, when joyous tears<br/>
And sweet sensations should have welcomed both,<br/>
Show what the passions are in their full growth.<br/>
<br/>
The father paused a moment, then withdrew<br/>
    His weapon, and replaced it; but stood still,<br/>
And looking on her, as to look her through,<br/>
    &lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;have sought this stranger&rsquo;s ill;<br/>
Not I have made this desolation: few<br/>
    Would bear such outrage, and forbear to kill;<br/>
But I must do my duty&mdash;how thou hast<br/>
Done thine, the present vouches for the past.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Let him disarm; or, by my father&rsquo;s head,<br/>
    His own shall roll before you like a ball!&rsquo;<br/>
He raised his whistle, as the word he said,<br/>
    And blew; another answer&rsquo;d to the call,<br/>
And rushing in disorderly, though led,<br/>
    And arm&rsquo;d from boot to turban, one and all,<br/>
Some twenty of his train came, rank on rank;<br/>
He gave the word,&mdash;&lsquo;Arrest or slay the Frank.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Then, with a sudden movement, he withdrew<br/>
    His daughter; while compress&rsquo;d within his clasp,<br/>
&rsquo;Twixt her and Juan interposed the crew;<br/>
    In vain she struggled in her father&rsquo;s grasp&mdash;<br/>
His arms were like a serpent&rsquo;s coil: then flew<br/>
    Upon their prey, as darts an angry asp,<br/>
The file of pirates; save the foremost, who<br/>
Had fallen, with his right shoulder half cut through.<br/>
<br/>
The second had his cheek laid open; but<br/>
    The third, a wary, cool old sworder, took<br/>
The blows upon his cutlass, and then put<br/>
    His own well in; so well, ere you could look,<br/>
His man was floor&rsquo;d, and helpless at his foot,<br/>
    With the blood running like a little brook<br/>
From two smart sabre gashes, deep and red&mdash;<br/>
One on the arm, the other on the head.<br/>
<br/>
And then they bound him where he fell, and bore<br/>
    Juan from the apartment: with a sign<br/>
Old Lambro bade them take him to the shore,<br/>
    Where lay some ships which were to sail at nine.<br/>
They laid him in a boat, and plied the oar<br/>
    Until they reach&rsquo;d some galliots, placed in line;<br/>
On board of one of these, and under hatches,<br/>
They stow&rsquo;d him, with strict orders to the watches.<br/>
<br/>
The world is full of strange vicissitudes,<br/>
    And here was one exceedingly unpleasant:<br/>
A gentleman so rich in the world&rsquo;s goods,<br/>
    Handsome and young, enjoying all the present,<br/>
Just at the very time when he least broods<br/>
    On such a thing is suddenly to sea sent,<br/>
Wounded and chain&rsquo;d, so that he cannot move,<br/>
And all because a lady fell in love.<br/>
<br/>
Here I must leave him, for I grow pathetic,<br/>
    Moved by the Chinese nymph of tears, green tea!<br/>
Than whom Cassandra was not more prophetic;<br/>
    For if my pure libations exceed three,<br/>
I feel my heart become so sympathetic,<br/>
    That I must have recourse to black Bohea:<br/>
&rsquo;Tis pity wine should be so deleterious,<br/>
For tea and coffee leave us much more serious,<br/>
<br/>
Unless when qualified with thee, Cogniac!<br/>
    Sweet Naiad of the Phlegethontic rill!<br/>
Ah! why the liver wilt thou thus attack,<br/>
    And make, like other nymphs, thy lovers ill?<br/>
I would take refuge in weak punch, but rack<br/>
    (In each sense of the word), whene&rsquo;er I fill<br/>
My mild and midnight beakers to the brim,<br/>
Wakes me next morning with its synonym.<br/>
<br/>
I leave Don Juan for the present, safe&mdash;<br/>
    Not sound, poor fellow, but severely wounded;<br/>
Yet could his corporal pangs amount to half<br/>
    Of those with which his Haidee&rsquo;s bosom bounded?<br/>
She was not one to weep, and rave, and chafe,<br/>
    And then give way, subdued because surrounded;<br/>
Her mother was a Moorish maid, from Fez,<br/>
Where all is Eden, or a wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
There the large olive rains its amber store<br/>
    In marble fonts; there grain, and flower, and fruit,<br/>
Gush from the earth until the land runs o&rsquo;er;<br/>
    But there, too, many a poison-tree has root,<br/>
And midnight listens to the lion&rsquo;s roar,<br/>
    And long, long deserts scorch the camel&rsquo;s foot,<br/>
Or heaving whelm the helpless caravan;<br/>
And as the soil is, so the heart of man.<br/>
<br/>
Afric is all the sun&rsquo;s, and as her earth<br/>
    Her human day is kindled; full of power<br/>
For good or evil, burning from its birth,<br/>
    The Moorish blood partakes the planet&rsquo;s hour,<br/>
And like the soil beneath it will bring forth:<br/>
    Beauty and love were Haidee&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s dower;<br/>
But her large dark eye show&rsquo;d deep Passion&rsquo;s force,<br/>
Though sleeping like a lion near a source.<br/>
<br/>
Her daughter, temper&rsquo;d with a milder ray,<br/>
    Like summer clouds all silvery, smooth, and fair,<br/>
Till slowly charged with thunder they display<br/>
    Terror to earth, and tempest to the air,<br/>
Had held till now her soft and milky way;<br/>
    But overwrought with passion and despair,<br/>
The fire burst forth from her Numidian veins,<br/>
Even as the Simoom sweeps the blasted plains.<br/>
<br/>
The last sight which she saw was Juan&rsquo;s gore,<br/>
    And he himself o&rsquo;ermaster&rsquo;d and cut down;<br/>
His blood was running on the very floor<br/>
    Where late he trod, her beautiful, her own;<br/>
Thus much she view&rsquo;d an instant and no more,&mdash;<br/>
    Her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan;<br/>
On her sire&rsquo;s arm, which until now scarce held<br/>
Her writhing, fell she like a cedar fell&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
A vein had burst, and her sweet lips&rsquo; pure dyes<br/>
    Were dabbled with the deep blood which ran o&rsquo;er;<br/>
And her head droop&rsquo;d as when the lily lies<br/>
    O&rsquo;ercharged with rain: her summon&rsquo;d handmaids bore<br/>
Their lady to her couch with gushing eyes;<br/>
    Of herbs and cordials they produced their store,<br/>
But she defied all means they could employ,<br/>
Like one life could not hold, nor death destroy.<br/>
<br/>
Days lay she in that state unchanged, though chill&mdash;<br/>
    With nothing livid, still her lips were red;<br/>
She had no pulse, but death seem&rsquo;d absent still;<br/>
    No hideous sign proclaim&rsquo;d her surely dead;<br/>
Corruption came not in each mind to kill<br/>
    All hope; to look upon her sweet face bred<br/>
New thoughts of life, for it seem&rsquo;d full of soul&mdash;<br/>
She had so much, earth could not claim the whole.<br/>
<br/>
The ruling passion, such as marble shows<br/>
    When exquisitely chisell&rsquo;d, still lay there,<br/>
But fix&rsquo;d as marble&rsquo;s unchanged aspect throws<br/>
    O&rsquo;er the fair Venus, but for ever fair;<br/>
O&rsquo;er the Laocoon&rsquo;s all eternal throes,<br/>
    And ever-dying Gladiator&rsquo;s air,<br/>
Their energy like life forms all their fame,<br/>
Yet looks not life, for they are still the same.<br/>
<br/>
She woke at length, but not as sleepers wake,<br/>
    Rather the dead, for life seem&rsquo;d something new,<br/>
A strange sensation which she must partake<br/>
    Perforce, since whatsoever met her view<br/>
Struck not on memory, though a heavy ache<br/>
    Lay at her heart, whose earliest beat still true<br/>
Brought back the sense of pain without the cause,<br/>
For, for a while, the furies made a pause.<br/>
<br/>
She look&rsquo;d on many a face with vacant eye,<br/>
    On many a token without knowing what;<br/>
She saw them watch her without asking why,<br/>
    And reck&rsquo;d not who around her pillow sat;<br/>
Not speechless, though she spoke not; not a sigh<br/>
    Relieved her thoughts; dull silence and quick chat<br/>
Were tried in vain by those who served; she gave<br/>
No sign, save breath, of having left the grave.<br/>
<br/>
Her handmaids tended, but she heeded not;<br/>
    Her father watch&rsquo;d, she turn&rsquo;d her eyes away;<br/>
She recognized no being, and no spot,<br/>
    However dear or cherish&rsquo;d in their day;<br/>
They changed from room to room&mdash;but all forgot&mdash;<br/>
    Gentle, but without memory she lay;<br/>
At length those eyes, which they would fain be weaning<br/>
Back to old thoughts, wax&rsquo;d full of fearful meaning.<br/>
<br/>
And then a slave bethought her of a harp;<br/>
    The harper came, and tuned his instrument;<br/>
At the first notes, irregular and sharp,<br/>
    On him her flashing eyes a moment bent,<br/>
Then to the wall she turn&rsquo;d as if to warp<br/>
    Her thoughts from sorrow through her heart re-sent;<br/>
And he begun a long low island song<br/>
Of ancient days, ere tyranny grew strong.<br/>
<br/>
Anon her thin wan fingers beat the wall<br/>
    In time to his old tune; he changed the theme,<br/>
And sung of love; the fierce name struck through all<br/>
    Her recollection; on her flash&rsquo;d the dream<br/>
Of what she was, and is, if ye could call<br/>
    To be so being; in a gushing stream<br/>
The tears rush&rsquo;d forth from her o&rsquo;erclouded brain,<br/>
Like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain.<br/>
<br/>
Short solace, vain relief!&mdash;thought came too quick,<br/>
    And whirl&rsquo;d her brain to madness; she arose<br/>
As one who ne&rsquo;er had dwelt among the sick,<br/>
    And flew at all she met, as on her foes;<br/>
But no one ever heard her speak or shriek,<br/>
    Although her paroxysm drew towards its dose;&mdash;<br/>
Hers was a phrensy which disdain&rsquo;d to rave,<br/>
Even when they smote her, in the hope to save.<br/>
<br/>
Yet she betray&rsquo;d at times a gleam of sense;<br/>
    Nothing could make her meet her father&rsquo;s face,<br/>
Though on all other things with looks intense<br/>
    She gazed, but none she ever could retrace;<br/>
Food she refused, and raiment; no pretence<br/>
    Avail&rsquo;d for either; neither change of place,<br/>
Nor time, nor skill, nor remedy, could give her<br/>
Senses to sleep&mdash;the power seem&rsquo;d gone for ever.<br/>
<br/>
Twelve days and nights she wither&rsquo;d thus; at last,<br/>
    Without a groan, or sigh, or glance, to show<br/>
A parting pang, the spirit from her past:<br/>
    And they who watch&rsquo;d her nearest could not know<br/>
The very instant, till the change that cast<br/>
    Her sweet face into shadow, dull and slow,<br/>
Glazed o&rsquo;er her eyes&mdash;the beautiful, the black&mdash;<br/>
O! to possess such lustre&mdash;and then lack!<br/>
<br/>
She died, but not alone; she held within<br/>
    A second principle of life, which might<br/>
Have dawn&rsquo;d a fair and sinless child of sin;<br/>
    But closed its little being without light,<br/>
And went down to the grave unborn, wherein<br/>
    Blossom and bough lie wither&rsquo;d with one blight;<br/>
In vain the dews of Heaven descend above<br/>
The bleeding flower and blasted fruit of love.<br/>
<br/>
Thus lived&mdash;thus died she; never more on her<br/>
    Shall sorrow light, or shame. She was not made<br/>
Through years or moons the inner weight to bear,<br/>
    Which colder hearts endure till they are laid<br/>
By age in earth: her days and pleasures were<br/>
    Brief, but delightful&mdash;such as had not staid<br/>
Long with her destiny; but she sleeps well<br/>
By the sea-shore, whereon she loved to dwell.<br/>
<br/>
That isle is now all desolate and bare,<br/>
    Its dwellings down, its tenants pass&rsquo;d away;<br/>
None but her own and father&rsquo;s grave is there,<br/>
    And nothing outward tells of human clay;<br/>
Ye could not know where lies a thing so fair,<br/>
    No stone is there to show, no tongue to say<br/>
What was; no dirge, except the hollow sea&rsquo;s,<br/>
Mourns o&rsquo;er the beauty of the Cyclades.<br/>
<br/>
But many a Greek maid in a loving song<br/>
    Sighs o&rsquo;er her name; and many an islander<br/>
With her sire&rsquo;s story makes the night less long;<br/>
    Valour was his, and beauty dwelt with her:<br/>
If she loved rashly, her life paid for wrong&mdash;<br/>
    A heavy price must all pay who thus err,<br/>
In some shape; let none think to fly the danger,<br/>
For soon or late Love is his own avenger.<br/>
<br/>
But let me change this theme which grows too sad,<br/>
    And lay this sheet of sorrows on the shelf;<br/>
I don&rsquo;t much like describing people mad,<br/>
    For fear of seeming rather touch&rsquo;d myself&mdash;<br/>
Besides, I&rsquo;ve no more on this head to add;<br/>
    And as my Muse is a capricious elf,<br/>
We&rsquo;ll put about, and try another tack<br/>
With Juan, left half-kill&rsquo;d some stanzas back.<br/>
<br/>
Wounded and fetter&rsquo;d, &lsquo;cabin&rsquo;d, cribb&rsquo;d, confined,&rsquo;<br/>
    Some days and nights elapsed before that he<br/>
Could altogether call the past to mind;<br/>
    And when he did, he found himself at sea,<br/>
Sailing six knots an hour before the wind;<br/>
    The shores of Ilion lay beneath their lee&mdash;<br/>
Another time he might have liked to see &rsquo;em,<br/>
But now was not much pleased with Cape Sigaeum.<br/>
<br/>
There, on the green and village-cotted hill, is<br/>
    (Flank&rsquo;d by the Hellespont and by the sea)<br/>
Entomb&rsquo;d the bravest of the brave, Achilles;<br/>
    They say so (Bryant says the contrary):<br/>
And further downward, tall and towering still, is<br/>
    The tumulus&mdash;of whom? Heaven knows! &rsquo;t may be<br/>
Patroclus, Ajax, or Protesilaus&mdash;<br/>
All heroes, who if living still would slay us.<br/>
<br/>
High barrows, without marble or a name,<br/>
    A vast, untill&rsquo;d, and mountain-skirted plain,<br/>
And Ida in the distance, still the same,<br/>
    And old Scamander (if &rsquo;tis he) remain;<br/>
The situation seems still form&rsquo;d for fame&mdash;<br/>
    A hundred thousand men might fight again<br/>
With case; but where I sought for Ilion&rsquo;s walls,<br/>
The quiet sheep feeds, and the tortoise crawls;<br/>
<br/>
Troops of untended horses; here and there<br/>
    Some little hamlets, with new names uncouth;<br/>
Some shepherds (unlike Paris) led to stare<br/>
    A moment at the European youth<br/>
Whom to the spot their school-boy feelings bear;<br/>
    A turk, with beads in hand and pipe in mouth,<br/>
Extremely taken with his own religion,<br/>
Are what I found there&mdash;but the devil a Phrygian.<br/>
<br/>
Don Juan, here permitted to emerge<br/>
    From his dull cabin, found himself a slave;<br/>
Forlorn, and gazing on the deep blue surge,<br/>
    O&rsquo;ershadow&rsquo;d there by many a hero&rsquo;s grave;<br/>
Weak still with loss of blood, he scarce could urge<br/>
    A few brief questions; and the answers gave<br/>
No very satisfactory information<br/>
About his past or present situation.<br/>
<br/>
He saw some fellow captives, who appear&rsquo;d<br/>
    To be Italians, as they were in fact;<br/>
From them, at least, their destiny he heard,<br/>
    Which was an odd one; a troop going to act<br/>
In Sicily (all singers, duly rear&rsquo;d<br/>
    In their vocation) had not been attack&rsquo;d<br/>
In sailing from Livorno by the pirate,<br/>
But sold by the impresario at no high rate.<br/>
<br/>
By one of these, the buffo of the party,<br/>
    Juan was told about their curious case;<br/>
For although destined to the Turkish mart, he<br/>
    Still kept his spirits up&mdash;at least his face;<br/>
The little fellow really look&rsquo;d quite hearty,<br/>
    And bore him with some gaiety and grace,<br/>
Showing a much more reconciled demeanour,<br/>
Than did the prima donna and the tenor.<br/>
<br/>
In a few words he told their hapless story,<br/>
    Saying, &lsquo;Our Machiavellian impresario,<br/>
Making a signal off some promontory,<br/>
    Hail&rsquo;d a strange brig&mdash;Corpo di Caio Mario!<br/>
We were transferr&rsquo;d on board her in a hurry,<br/>
    Without a Single scudo of salario;<br/>
But if the Sultan has a taste for song,<br/>
We will revive our fortunes before long.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;The prima donna, though a little old,<br/>
    And haggard with a dissipated life,<br/>
And subject, when the house is thin, to cold,<br/>
    Has some good notes; and then the tenor&rsquo;s wife,<br/>
With no great voice, is pleasing to behold;<br/>
    Last carnival she made a deal of strife<br/>
By carrying off Count Cesare Cicogna<br/>
From an old Roman princess at Bologna.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;And then there are the dancers; there&rsquo;s the Nini,<br/>
    With more than one profession, gains by all;<br/>
Then there&rsquo;s that laughing slut the Pelegrini,<br/>
    She, too, was fortunate last carnival,<br/>
And made at least five hundred good zecchini,<br/>
    But spends so fast, she has not now a paul;<br/>
And then there&rsquo;s the Grotesca&mdash;such a dancer!<br/>
Where men have souls or bodies she must answer.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;As for the figuranti, they are like<br/>
    The rest of all that tribe; with here and there<br/>
A pretty person, which perhaps may strike,<br/>
    The rest are hardly fitted for a fair;<br/>
There&rsquo;s one, though tall and stiffer than a pike,<br/>
    Yet has a sentimental kind of air<br/>
Which might go far, but she don&rsquo;t dance with vigour;<br/>
The more &rsquo;s the pity, with her face and figure.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;As for the men, they are a middling set;<br/>
    The musico is but a crack&rsquo;d old basin,<br/>
But being qualified in one way yet,<br/>
    May the seraglio do to set his face in,<br/>
And as a servant some preferment get;<br/>
    His singing I no further trust can place in:<br/>
From all the Pope makes yearly &rsquo;twould perplex<br/>
To find three perfect pipes of the third sex.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;The tenor&rsquo;s voice is spoilt by affectation,<br/>
    And for the bass, the beast can only bellow;<br/>
In fact, he had no singing education,<br/>
    An ignorant, noteless, timeless, tuneless fellow;<br/>
But being the prima donna&rsquo;s near relation,<br/>
    Who swore his voice was very rich and mellow,<br/>
They hired him, though to hear him you&rsquo;d believe<br/>
An ass was practising recitative.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;&rsquo;Twould not become myself to dwell upon<br/>
    My own merits, and though young&mdash;I see, Sir&mdash;you<br/>
Have got a travell&rsquo;d air, which speaks you one<br/>
    To whom the opera is by no means new:<br/>
You&rsquo;ve heard of Raucocanti?&mdash;I&rsquo;m the man;<br/>
    The time may come when you may hear me too;<br/>
You was not last year at the fair of Lugo,<br/>
But next, when I&rsquo;m engaged to sing there&mdash;do go.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Our baritone I almost had forgot,<br/>
    A pretty lad, but bursting with conceit;<br/>
With graceful action, science not a jot,<br/>
    A voice of no great compass, and not sweet,<br/>
He always is complaining of his lot,<br/>
    Forsooth, scarce fit for ballads in the street;<br/>
In lovers&rsquo; parts his passion more to breathe,<br/>
Having no heart to show, he shows his teeth.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Here Raucocanti&rsquo;s eloquent recital<br/>
    Was interrupted by the pirate crew,<br/>
Who came at stated moments to invite all<br/>
    The captives back to their sad berths; each threw<br/>
A rueful glance upon the waves (which bright all<br/>
    From the blue skies derived a double blue,<br/>
Dancing all free and happy in the sun),<br/>
And then went down the hatchway one by one.<br/>
<br/>
They heard next day&mdash;that in the Dardanelles,<br/>
    Waiting for his Sublimity&rsquo;s firman,<br/>
The most imperative of sovereign spells,<br/>
    Which every body does without who can,<br/>
More to secure them in their naval cells,<br/>
    Lady to lady, well as man to man,<br/>
Were to be chain&rsquo;d and lotted out per couple,<br/>
For the slave market of Constantinople.<br/>
<br/>
It seems when this allotment was made out,<br/>
    There chanced to be an odd male, and odd female,<br/>
Who (after some discussion and some doubt,<br/>
    If the soprano might be deem&rsquo;d to be male,<br/>
They placed him o&rsquo;er the women as a scout)<br/>
    Were link&rsquo;d together, and it happen&rsquo;d the male<br/>
Was Juan,&mdash;who, an awkward thing at his age,<br/>
Pair&rsquo;d off with a Bacchante blooming visage.<br/>
<br/>
With Raucocanti lucklessly was chain&rsquo;d<br/>
    The tenor; these two hated with a hate<br/>
Found only on the stage, and each more pain&rsquo;d<br/>
    With this his tuneful neighbour than his fate;<br/>
Sad strife arose, for they were so cross-grain&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Instead of bearing up without debate,<br/>
That each pull&rsquo;d different ways with many an oath,<br/>
&lsquo;Arcades ambo,&rsquo; id est&mdash;blackguards both.<br/>
<br/>
Juan&rsquo;s companion was a Romagnole,<br/>
    But bred within the March of old Ancona,<br/>
With eyes that look&rsquo;d into the very soul<br/>
    (And other chief points of a &lsquo;bella donna&rsquo;),<br/>
Bright&mdash;and as black and burning as a coal;<br/>
    And through her dear brunette complexion shone<br/>
Great wish to please&mdash;a most attractive dower,<br/>
Especially when added to the power.<br/>
<br/>
But all that power was wasted upon him,<br/>
    For sorrow o&rsquo;er each sense held stern command;<br/>
Her eye might flash on his, but found it dim;<br/>
    And though thus chain&rsquo;d, as natural her hand<br/>
Touch&rsquo;d his, nor that&mdash;nor any handsome limb<br/>
    (And she had some not easy to withstand)<br/>
Could stir his pulse, or make his faith feel brittle;<br/>
Perhaps his recent wounds might help a little.<br/>
<br/>
No matter; we should ne&rsquo;er too much enquire,<br/>
    But facts are facts: no knight could be more true,<br/>
And firmer faith no ladye&mdash;love desire;<br/>
    We will omit the proofs, save one or two:<br/>
&rsquo;Tis said no one in hand &lsquo;can hold a fire<br/>
    By thought of frosty Caucasus;&rsquo; but few,<br/>
I really think; yet Juan&rsquo;s then ordeal<br/>
Was more triumphant, and not much less real.<br/>
<br/>
Here I might enter on a chaste description,<br/>
    Having withstood temptation in my youth,<br/>
But hear that several people take exception<br/>
    At the first two books having too much truth;<br/>
Therefore I&rsquo;ll make Don Juan leave the ship soon,<br/>
    Because the publisher declares, in sooth,<br/>
Through needles&rsquo; eyes it easier for the camel is<br/>
To pass, than those two cantos into families.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis all the same to me; I&rsquo;m fond of yielding,<br/>
    And therefore leave them to the purer page<br/>
Of Smollett, Prior, Ariosto, Fielding,<br/>
    Who say strange things for so correct an age;<br/>
I once had great alacrity in wielding<br/>
    My pen, and liked poetic war to wage,<br/>
And recollect the time when all this cant<br/>
Would have provoked remarks which now it shan&rsquo;t.<br/>
<br/>
As boys love rows, my boyhood liked a squabble;<br/>
    But at this hour I wish to part in peace,<br/>
Leaving such to the literary rabble:<br/>
    Whether my verse&rsquo;s fame be doom&rsquo;d to cease<br/>
While the right hand which wrote it still is able,<br/>
    Or of some centuries to take a lease,<br/>
The grass upon my grave will grow as long,<br/>
And sigh to midnight winds, but not to song.<br/>
<br/>
Of poets who come down to us through distance<br/>
    Of time and tongues, the foster-babes of Fame,<br/>
Life seems the smallest portion of existence;<br/>
    Where twenty ages gather o&rsquo;er a name,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis as a snowball which derives assistance<br/>
    From every flake, and yet rolls on the same,<br/>
Even till an iceberg it may chance to grow;<br/>
But, after all, &rsquo;tis nothing but cold snow.<br/>
<br/>
And so great names are nothing more than nominal,<br/>
    And love of glory &rsquo;s but an airy lust,<br/>
Too often in its fury overcoming all<br/>
    Who would as &rsquo;twere identify their dust<br/>
From out the wide destruction, which, entombing all,<br/>
    Leaves nothing till &lsquo;the coming of the just&rsquo;-<br/>
Save change: I&rsquo;ve stood upon Achilles&rsquo; tomb,<br/>
And heard Troy doubted; time will doubt of Rome.<br/>
<br/>
The very generations of the dead<br/>
    Are swept away, and tomb inherits tomb,<br/>
Until the memory of an age is fled,<br/>
    And, buried, sinks beneath its offspring&rsquo;s doom:<br/>
Where are the epitaphs our fathers read?<br/>
    Save a few glean&rsquo;d from the sepulchral gloom<br/>
Which once-named myriads nameless lie beneath,<br/>
And lose their own in universal death.<br/>
<br/>
I canter by the spot each afternoon<br/>
    Where perish&rsquo;d in his fame the hero-boy,<br/>
Who lived too long for men, but died too soon<br/>
    For human vanity, the young De Foix!<br/>
A broken pillar, not uncouthly hewn,<br/>
    But which neglect is hastening to destroy,<br/>
Records Ravenna&rsquo;s carnage on its face,<br/>
While weeds and ordure rankle round the base.<br/>
<br/>
I pass each day where Dante&rsquo;s bones are laid:<br/>
    A little cupola, more neat than solemn,<br/>
Protects his dust, but reverence here is paid<br/>
    To the bard&rsquo;s tomb, and not the warrior&rsquo;s column.<br/>
The time must come, when both alike decay&rsquo;d,<br/>
    The chieftain&rsquo;s trophy, and the poet&rsquo;s volume,<br/>
Will sink where lie the songs and wars of earth,<br/>
Before Pelides&rsquo; death, or Homer&rsquo;s birth.<br/>
<br/>
With human blood that column was cemented,<br/>
    With human filth that column is defiled,<br/>
As if the peasant&rsquo;s coarse contempt were vented<br/>
    To show his loathing of the spot he soil&rsquo;d:<br/>
Thus is the trophy used, and thus lamented<br/>
    Should ever be those blood-hounds, from whose wild<br/>
Instinct of gore and glory earth has known<br/>
Those sufferings Dante saw in hell alone.<br/>
<br/>
Yet there will still be bards: though fame is smoke,<br/>
    Its fumes are frankincense to human thought;<br/>
And the unquiet feelings, which first woke<br/>
    Song in the world, will seek what then they sought;<br/>
As on the beach the waves at last are broke,<br/>
    Thus to their extreme verge the passions brought<br/>
Dash into poetry, which is but passion,<br/>
Or at least was so ere it grew a fashion.<br/>
<br/>
If in the course of such a life as was<br/>
    At once adventurous and contemplative,<br/>
Men, who partake all passions as they pass,<br/>
    Acquire the deep and bitter power to give<br/>
Their images again as in a glass,<br/>
    And in such colours that they seem to live;<br/>
You may do right forbidding them to show &rsquo;em,<br/>
But spoil (I think) a very pretty poem.<br/>
<br/>
O! ye, who make the fortunes of all books!<br/>
    Benign Ceruleans of the second sex!<br/>
Who advertise new poems by your looks,<br/>
    Your &lsquo;imprimatur&rsquo; will ye not annex?<br/>
What! must I go to the oblivious cooks,<br/>
    Those Cornish plunderers of Parnassian wrecks?<br/>
Ah! must I then the only minstrel be,<br/>
Proscribed from tasting your Castalian tea!<br/>
<br/>
What! can I prove &lsquo;a lion&rsquo; then no more?<br/>
    A ball-room bard, a foolscap, hot-press darling?<br/>
To bear the compliments of many a bore,<br/>
    And sigh, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t get out,&rsquo; like Yorick&rsquo;s starling;<br/>
Why then I&rsquo;ll swear, as poet Wordy swore<br/>
    (Because the world won&rsquo;t read him, always snarling),<br/>
That taste is gone, that fame is but a lottery,<br/>
Drawn by the blue-coat misses of a coterie.<br/>
<br/>
O! &lsquo;darkly, deeply, beautifully blue,&rsquo;<br/>
    As some one somewhere sings about the sky,<br/>
And I, ye learned ladies, say of you;<br/>
    They say your stockings are so (Heaven knows why,<br/>
I have examined few pair of that hue);<br/>
    Blue as the garters which serenely lie<br/>
Round the Patrician left-legs, which adorn<br/>
The festal midnight, and the levee morn.<br/>
<br/>
Yet some of you are most seraphic creatures&mdash;<br/>
    But times are alter&rsquo;d since, a rhyming lover,<br/>
You read my stanzas, and I read your features:<br/>
    And&mdash;but no matter, all those things are over;<br/>
Still I have no dislike to learned natures,<br/>
    For sometimes such a world of virtues cover;<br/>
I knew one woman of that purple school,<br/>
The loveliest, chastest, best, but&mdash;quite a fool.<br/>
<br/>
Humboldt, &lsquo;the first of travellers,&rsquo; but not<br/>
    The last, if late accounts be accurate,<br/>
Invented, by some name I have forgot,<br/>
    As well as the sublime discovery&rsquo;s date,<br/>
An airy instrument, with which he sought<br/>
    To ascertain the atmospheric state,<br/>
By measuring &lsquo;the intensity of blue:&rsquo;<br/>
O, Lady Daphne! let me measure you!<br/>
<br/>
But to the narrative:&mdash;The vessel bound<br/>
    With slaves to sell off in the capital,<br/>
After the usual process, might be found<br/>
    At anchor under the seraglio wall;<br/>
Her cargo, from the plague being safe and sound,<br/>
    Were landed in the market, one and all,<br/>
And there with Georgians, Russians, and Circassians,<br/>
Bought up for different purposes and passions.<br/>
<br/>
Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars<br/>
    For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,<br/>
Warranted virgin; beauty&rsquo;s brightest colours<br/>
    Had deck&rsquo;d her out in all the hues of heaven:<br/>
Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,<br/>
    Who bade on till the hundreds reach&rsquo;d eleven;<br/>
But when the offer went beyond, they knew<br/>
&rsquo;Twas for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.<br/>
<br/>
Twelve negresses from Nubia brought a price<br/>
    Which the West Indian market scarce would bring;<br/>
Though Wilberforce, at last, has made it twice<br/>
    What &rsquo;twas ere Abolition; and the thing<br/>
Need not seem very wonderful, for vice<br/>
    Is always much more splendid than a king:<br/>
The virtues, even the most exalted, Charity,<br/>
Are saving&mdash;vice spares nothing for a rarity.<br/>
<br/>
But for the destiny of this young troop,<br/>
    How some were bought by pachas, some by Jews,<br/>
How some to burdens were obliged to stoop,<br/>
    And others rose to the command of crews<br/>
As renegadoes; while in hapless group,<br/>
    Hoping no very old vizier might choose,<br/>
The females stood, as one by one they pick&rsquo;d &rsquo;em,<br/>
To make a mistress, or fourth wife, or victim:<br/>
<br/>
All this must be reserved for further song;<br/>
    Also our hero&rsquo;s lot, howe&rsquo;er unpleasant<br/>
(Because this Canto has become too long),<br/>
    Must be postponed discreetly for the present;<br/>
I&rsquo;m sensible redundancy is wrong,<br/>
    But could not for the muse of me put less in &rsquo;t:<br/>
And now delay the progress of Don Juan,<br/>
Till what is call&rsquo;d in Ossian the fifth Juan.<br/>

CANTO THE FIFTH.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
When amatory poets sing their loves<br/>
    In liquid lines mellifluously bland,<br/>
And pair their rhymes as Venus yokes her doves,<br/>
    They little think what mischief is in hand;<br/>
The greater their success the worse it proves,<br/>
    As Ovid&rsquo;s verse may give to understand;<br/>
Even Petrarch&rsquo;s self, if judged with due severity,<br/>
Is the Platonic pimp of all posterity.<br/>
<br/>
I therefore do denounce all amorous writing,<br/>
    Except in such a way as not to attract;<br/>
Plain&mdash;simple&mdash;short, and by no means inviting,<br/>
    But with a moral to each error tack&rsquo;d,<br/>
Form&rsquo;d rather for instructing than delighting,<br/>
    And with all passions in their turn attack&rsquo;d;<br/>
Now, if my Pegasus should not be shod ill,<br/>
This poem will become a moral model.<br/>
<br/>
The European with the Asian shore<br/>
    Sprinkled with palaces; the ocean stream<br/>
Here and there studded with a seventy-four;<br/>
    Sophia&rsquo;s cupola with golden gleam;<br/>
The cypress groves; Olympus high and hoar;<br/>
    The twelve isles, and the more than I could dream,<br/>
Far less describe, present the very view<br/>
Which charm&rsquo;d the charming Mary Montagu.<br/>
<br/>
I have a passion for the name of &lsquo;Mary,&rsquo;<br/>
    For once it was a magic sound to me;<br/>
And still it half calls up the realms of fairy,<br/>
    Where I beheld what never was to be;<br/>
All feelings changed, but this was last to vary,<br/>
    A spell from which even yet I am not quite free:<br/>
But I grow sad&mdash;and let a tale grow cold,<br/>
Which must not be pathetically told.<br/>
<br/>
The wind swept down the Euxine, and the wave<br/>
    Broke foaming o&rsquo;er the blue Symplegades;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis a grand sight from off &lsquo;the Giant&rsquo;s Grave<br/>
    To watch the progress of those rolling seas<br/>
Between the Bosphorus, as they lash and lave<br/>
    Europe and Asia, you being quite at ease;<br/>
There&rsquo;s not a sea the passenger e&rsquo;er pukes in,<br/>
Turns up more dangerous breakers than the Euxine.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Twas a raw day of Autumn&rsquo;s bleak beginning,<br/>
    When nights are equal, but not so the days;<br/>
The Parcae then cut short the further spinning<br/>
    Of seamen&rsquo;s fates, and the loud tempests raise<br/>
The waters, and repentance for past sinning<br/>
    In all, who o&rsquo;er the great deep take their ways:<br/>
They vow to amend their lives, and yet they don&rsquo;t;<br/>
Because if drown&rsquo;d, they can&rsquo;t&mdash;if spared, they won&rsquo;t.<br/>
<br/>
A crowd of shivering slaves of every nation,<br/>
    And age, and sex, were in the market ranged;<br/>
Each bevy with the merchant in his station:<br/>
    Poor creatures! their good looks were sadly changed.<br/>
All save the blacks seem&rsquo;d jaded with vexation,<br/>
    From friends, and home, and freedom far estranged;<br/>
The negroes more philosophy display&rsquo;d,&mdash;<br/>
Used to it, no doubt, as eels are to be flay&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
Juan was juvenile, and thus was full,<br/>
    As most at his age are, of hope and health;<br/>
Yet I must own he looked a little dull,<br/>
    And now and then a tear stole down by stealth;<br/>
Perhaps his recent loss of blood might pull<br/>
    His spirit down; and then the loss of wealth,<br/>
A mistress, and such comfortable quarters,<br/>
To be put up for auction amongst Tartars,<br/>
<br/>
Were things to shake a stoic; ne&rsquo;ertheless,<br/>
    Upon the whole his carriage was serene:<br/>
His figure, and the splendour of his dress,<br/>
    Of which some gilded remnants still were seen,<br/>
Drew all eyes on him, giving them to guess<br/>
    He was above the vulgar by his mien;<br/>
And then, though pale, he was so very handsome;<br/>
And then&mdash;they calculated on his ransom.<br/>
<br/>
Like a backgammon board the place was dotted<br/>
    With whites and blacks, in groups on show for sale,<br/>
Though rather more irregularly spotted:<br/>
    Some bought the jet, while others chose the pale.<br/>
It chanced amongst the other people lotted,<br/>
    A man of thirty rather stout and hale,<br/>
With resolution in his dark grey eye,<br/>
Next Juan stood, till some might choose to buy.<br/>
<br/>
He had an English look; that is, was square<br/>
    In make, of a complexion white and ruddy,<br/>
Good teeth, with curling rather dark brown hair,<br/>
    And, it might be from thought or toil or study,<br/>
An open brow a little mark&rsquo;d with care:<br/>
    One arm had on a bandage rather bloody;<br/>
And there he stood with such sang-froid, that greater<br/>
Could scarce be shown even by a mere spectator.<br/>
<br/>
But seeing at his elbow a mere lad,<br/>
    Of a high spirit evidently, though<br/>
At present weigh&rsquo;d down by a doom which had<br/>
    O&rsquo;erthrown even men, he soon began to show<br/>
A kind of blunt compassion for the sad<br/>
    Lot of so young a partner in the woe,<br/>
Which for himself he seem&rsquo;d to deem no worse<br/>
Than any other scrape, a thing of course.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;My boy!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;amidst this motley crew<br/>
    Of Georgians, Russians, Nubians, and what not,<br/>
All ragamuffins differing but in hue,<br/>
    With whom it is our luck to cast our lot,<br/>
The only gentlemen seem I and you;<br/>
    So let us be acquainted, as we ought:<br/>
If I could yield you any consolation,<br/>
&rsquo;Twould give me pleasure.&mdash;Pray, what is your nation?&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
When Juan answer&rsquo;d&mdash;&lsquo;Spanish!&rsquo; he replied,<br/>
    &lsquo;I thought, in fact, you could not be a Greek;<br/>
Those servile dogs are not so proudly eyed:<br/>
    Fortune has play&rsquo;d you here a pretty freak,<br/>
But that &rsquo;s her way with all men, till they&rsquo;re tried;<br/>
    But never mind,&mdash;she&rsquo;ll turn, perhaps, next week;<br/>
She has served me also much the same as you,<br/>
Except that I have found it nothing new.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Pray, sir,&rsquo; said Juan, &lsquo;if I may presume,<br/>
    What brought you here?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oh! nothing very rare&mdash;<br/>
Six Tartars and a drag-chain.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;To this doom<br/>
    But what conducted, if the question&rsquo;s fair,<br/>
Is that which I would learn.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I served for some<br/>
    Months with the Russian army here and there,<br/>
And taking lately, by Suwarrow&rsquo;s bidding,<br/>
A town, was ta&rsquo;en myself instead of Widdin.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Have you no friends?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I had&mdash;but, by God&rsquo;s blessing,<br/>
    Have not been troubled with them lately. Now<br/>
I have answer&rsquo;d all your questions without pressing,<br/>
    And you an equal courtesy should show.&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said Juan, &lsquo;&rsquo;twere a tale distressing,<br/>
    And long besides.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oh! if &rsquo;tis really so,<br/>
You&rsquo;re right on both accounts to hold your tongue;<br/>
A sad tale saddens doubly, when &rsquo;tis long.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;But droop not: Fortune at your time of life,<br/>
    Although a female moderately fickle,<br/>
Will hardly leave you (as she &rsquo;s not your wife)<br/>
    For any length of days in such a pickle.<br/>
To strive, too, with our fate were such a strife<br/>
    As if the corn-sheaf should oppose the sickle:<br/>
Men are the sport of circumstances, when<br/>
The circumstances seem the sport of men.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis not,&rsquo; said Juan, &lsquo;for my present doom<br/>
    I mourn, but for the past;&mdash;I loved a maid:&rsquo;-<br/>
He paused, and his dark eye grew full of gloom;<br/>
    A single tear upon his eyelash staid<br/>
A moment, and then dropp&rsquo;d; &lsquo;but to resume,<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis not my present lot, as I have said,<br/>
Which I deplore so much; for I have borne<br/>
Hardships which have the hardiest overworn,<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;On the rough deep. But this last blow-&rsquo; and here<br/>
    He stopp&rsquo;d again, and turn&rsquo;d away his face.<br/>
&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; quoth his friend, &lsquo;I thought it would appear<br/>
    That there had been a lady in the case;<br/>
And these are things which ask a tender tear,<br/>
    Such as I, too, would shed if in your place:<br/>
I cried upon my first wife&rsquo;s dying day,<br/>
And also when my second ran away:<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;My third-&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Your third!&rsquo; quoth Juan, turning round;<br/>
    &lsquo;You scarcely can be thirty: have you three?&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;No&mdash;only two at present above ground:<br/>
    Surely &rsquo;tis nothing wonderful to see<br/>
One person thrice in holy wedlock bound!&rsquo;<br/>
    &lsquo;Well, then, your third,&rsquo; said Juan; &lsquo;what did she?<br/>
She did not run away, too,&mdash;did she, sir?&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;No, faith.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What then?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I ran away from her.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;You take things coolly, sir,&rsquo; said Juan. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo;<br/>
    Replied the other, &lsquo;what can a man do?<br/>
There still are many rainbows in your sky,<br/>
    But mine have vanish&rsquo;d. All, when life is new,<br/>
Commence with feelings warm, and prospects high;<br/>
    But time strips our illusions of their hue,<br/>
And one by one in turn, some grand mistake<br/>
Casts off its bright skin yearly like the snake.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis true, it gets another bright and fresh,<br/>
    Or fresher, brighter; but the year gone through,<br/>
This skin must go the way, too, of all flesh,<br/>
    Or sometimes only wear a week or two;&mdash;<br/>
Love &rsquo;s the first net which spreads its deadly mesh;<br/>
    Ambition, Avarice, Vengeance, Glory, glue<br/>
The glittering lime-twigs of our latter days,<br/>
Where still we flutter on for pence or praise.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;All this is very fine, and may be true,&rsquo;<br/>
    Said Juan; &lsquo;but I really don&rsquo;t see how<br/>
It betters present times with me or you.&rsquo;<br/>
    &lsquo;No?&rsquo; quoth the other; &lsquo;yet you will allow<br/>
By setting things in their right point of view,<br/>
    Knowledge, at least, is gain&rsquo;d; for instance, now,<br/>
We know what slavery is, and our disasters<br/>
May teach us better to behave when masters.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Would we were masters now, if but to try<br/>
    Their present lessons on our Pagan friends here,&rsquo;<br/>
Said Juan,&mdash;swallowing a heart-burning sigh:<br/>
    &lsquo;Heaven help the scholar whom his fortune sends here!&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;Perhaps we shall be one day, by and by,&rsquo;<br/>
    Rejoin&rsquo;d the other, when our bad luck mends here;<br/>
Meantime (yon old black eunuch seems to eye us)<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;But after all, what is our present state?<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis bad, and may be better&mdash;all men&rsquo;s lot:<br/>
Most men are slaves, none more so than the great,<br/>
    To their own whims and passions, and what not;<br/>
Society itself, which should create<br/>
    Kindness, destroys what little we had got:<br/>
To feel for none is the true social art<br/>
Of the world&rsquo;s stoics&mdash;men without a heart.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Just now a black old neutral personage<br/>
    Of the third sex stept up, and peering over<br/>
The captives, seem&rsquo;d to mark their looks and age,<br/>
    And capabilities, as to discover<br/>
If they were fitted for the purposed cage:<br/>
    No lady e&rsquo;er is ogled by a lover,<br/>
Horse by a blackleg, broadcloth by a tailor,<br/>
Fee by a counsel, felon by a jailor,<br/>
<br/>
As is a slave by his intended bidder.<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis pleasant purchasing our fellow-creatures;<br/>
And all are to be sold, if you consider<br/>
    Their passions, and are dext&rsquo;rous; some by features<br/>
Are bought up, others by a warlike leader,<br/>
    Some by a place&mdash;as tend their years or natures;<br/>
The most by ready cash&mdash;but all have prices,<br/>
From crowns to kicks, according to their vices.<br/>
<br/>
The eunuch, having eyed them o&rsquo;er with care,<br/>
    Turn&rsquo;d to the merchant, and begun to bid<br/>
First but for one, and after for the pair;<br/>
    They haggled, wrangled, swore, too&mdash;so they did!<br/>
As though they were in a mere Christian fair<br/>
    Cheapening an ox, an ass, a lamb, or kid;<br/>
So that their bargain sounded like a battle<br/>
For this superior yoke of human cattle.<br/>
<br/>
At last they settled into simple grumbling,<br/>
    And pulling out reluctant purses, and<br/>
Turning each piece of silver o&rsquo;er, and tumbling<br/>
    Some down, and weighing others in their hand,<br/>
And by mistake sequins with paras jumbling,<br/>
    Until the sum was accurately scann&rsquo;d,<br/>
And then the merchant giving change, and signing<br/>
Receipts in full, began to think of dining.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if his appetite was good?<br/>
    Or, if it were, if also his digestion?<br/>
Methinks at meals some odd thoughts might intrude,<br/>
    And conscience ask a curious sort of question,<br/>
About the right divine how far we should<br/>
    Sell flesh and blood. When dinner has opprest one,<br/>
I think it is perhaps the gloomiest hour<br/>
Which turns up out of the sad twenty-four.<br/>
<br/>
Voltaire says &lsquo;No:&rsquo; he tells you that Candide<br/>
    Found life most tolerable after meals;<br/>
He &rsquo;s wrong&mdash;unless man were a pig, indeed,<br/>
    Repletion rather adds to what he feels,<br/>
Unless he &rsquo;s drunk, and then no doubt he &rsquo;s freed<br/>
    From his own brain&rsquo;s oppression while it reels.<br/>
Of food I think with Philip&rsquo;s son, or rather<br/>
Ammon&rsquo;s (ill pleased with one world and one father);<br/>
<br/>
I think with Alexander, that the act<br/>
    Of eating, with another act or two,<br/>
Makes us feel our mortality in fact<br/>
    Redoubled; when a roast and a ragout,<br/>
And fish, and soup, by some side dishes back&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Can give us either pain or pleasure, who<br/>
Would pique himself on intellects, whose use<br/>
Depends so much upon the gastric juice?<br/>
<br/>
The other evening (&rsquo;twas on Friday last)&mdash;<br/>
    This is a fact and no poetic fable&mdash;<br/>
Just as my great coat was about me cast,<br/>
    My hat and gloves still lying on the table,<br/>
I heard a shot&mdash;&rsquo;twas eight o&rsquo;clock scarce past&mdash;<br/>
    And, running out as fast as I was able,<br/>
I found the military commandant<br/>
Stretch&rsquo;d in the street, and able scarce to pant.<br/>
<br/>
Poor fellow! for some reason, surely bad,<br/>
    They had slain him with five slugs; and left him there<br/>
To perish on the pavement: so I had<br/>
    Him borne into the house and up the stair,<br/>
And stripp&rsquo;d and look&rsquo;d to&mdash;But why should I ad<br/>
    More circumstances? vain was every care;<br/>
The man was gone: in some Italian quarrel<br/>
Kill&rsquo;d by five bullets from an old gun-barrel.<br/>
<br/>
I gazed upon him, for I knew him well;<br/>
    And though I have seen many corpses, never<br/>
Saw one, whom such an accident befell,<br/>
    So calm; though pierced through stomach, heart, and liver,<br/>
He seem&rsquo;d to sleep,&mdash;for you could scarcely tell<br/>
    (As he bled inwardly, no hideous river<br/>
Of gore divulged the cause) that he was dead:<br/>
So as I gazed on him, I thought or said&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Can this be death? then what is life or death?<br/>
    Speak!&rsquo; but he spoke not: &lsquo;Wake!&rsquo; but still he slept:&mdash;<br/>
&lsquo;But yesterday and who had mightier breath?<br/>
    A thousand warriors by his word were kept<br/>
In awe: he said, as the centurion saith,<br/>
    &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; and he goeth; &ldquo;come,&rdquo; and forth he stepp&rsquo;d.<br/>
The trump and bugle till he spake were dumb&mdash;<br/>
And now nought left him but the muffled drum.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
And they who waited once and worshipp&rsquo;d&mdash;they<br/>
    With their rough faces throng&rsquo;d about the bed<br/>
To gaze once more on the commanding clay<br/>
    Which for the last, though not the first, time bled:<br/>
And such an end! that he who many a day<br/>
    Had faced Napoleon&rsquo;s foes until they fled,&mdash;<br/>
The foremost in the charge or in the sally,<br/>
Should now be butcher&rsquo;d in a civic alley.<br/>
<br/>
The scars of his old wounds were near his new,<br/>
    Those honourable scars which brought him fame;<br/>
And horrid was the contrast to the view&mdash;<br/>
    But let me quit the theme; as such things claim<br/>
Perhaps even more attention than is due<br/>
    From me: I gazed (as oft I have gazed the same)<br/>
To try if I could wrench aught out of death<br/>
Which should confirm, or shake, or make a faith;<br/>
<br/>
But it was all a mystery. Here we are,<br/>
    And there we go:&mdash;but where? five bits of lead,<br/>
Or three, or two, or one, send very far!<br/>
    And is this blood, then, form&rsquo;d but to be shed?<br/>
Can every element our elements mar?<br/>
    And air&mdash;earth&mdash;water&mdash;fire live&mdash;and we dead?<br/>
We whose minds comprehend all things? No more;<br/>
But let us to the story as before.<br/>
<br/>
The purchaser of Juan and acquaintance<br/>
    Bore off his bargains to a gilded boat,<br/>
Embark&rsquo;d himself and them, and off they went thence<br/>
    As fast as oars could pull and water float;<br/>
They look&rsquo;d like persons being led to sentence,<br/>
    Wondering what next, till the caique was brought<br/>
Up in a little creek below a wall<br/>
O&rsquo;ertopp&rsquo;d with cypresses, dark-green and tall.<br/>
<br/>
Here their conductor tapping at the wicket<br/>
    Of a small iron door, &rsquo;twas open&rsquo;d, and<br/>
He led them onward, first through a low thicket<br/>
    Flank&rsquo;d by large groves, which tower&rsquo;d on either hand:<br/>
They almost lost their way, and had to pick it&mdash;<br/>
    For night was dosing ere they came to land.<br/>
The eunuch made a sign to those on board,<br/>
Who row&rsquo;d off, leaving them without a word.<br/>
<br/>
As they were plodding on their winding way<br/>
    Through orange bowers, and jasmine, and so forth<br/>
(Of which I might have a good deal to say,<br/>
    There being no such profusion in the North<br/>
Of oriental plants, &lsquo;et cetera,&rsquo;<br/>
    But that of late your scribblers think it worth<br/>
Their while to rear whole hotbeds in their works<br/>
Because one poet travell&rsquo;d &rsquo;mongst the Turks)&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
As they were threading on their way, there came<br/>
    Into Don Juan&rsquo;s head a thought, which he<br/>
Whisper&rsquo;d to his companion:&mdash;&rsquo;twas the same<br/>
    Which might have then occurr&rsquo;d to you or me.<br/>
&lsquo;Methinks,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;it would be no great shame<br/>
    If we should strike a stroke to set us free;<br/>
Let &rsquo;s knock that old black fellow on the head,<br/>
And march away&mdash;&rsquo;twere easier done than said.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;and when done, what then?<br/>
    How get out? how the devil got we in?<br/>
And when we once were fairly out, and when<br/>
    From Saint Bartholomew we have saved our skin,<br/>
To-morrow &rsquo;d see us in some other den,<br/>
    And worse off than we hitherto have been;<br/>
Besides, I&rsquo;m hungry, and just now would take,<br/>
Like Esau, for my birthright a beef-steak.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;We must be near some place of man&rsquo;s abode;&mdash;<br/>
    For the old negro&rsquo;s confidence in creeping,<br/>
With his two captives, by so queer a road,<br/>
    Shows that he thinks his friends have not been sleeping;<br/>
A single cry would bring them all abroad:<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis therefore better looking before leaping&mdash;<br/>
And there, you see, this turn has brought us through,<br/>
By Jove, a noble palace!&mdash;lighted too.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
It was indeed a wide extensive building<br/>
    Which open&rsquo;d on their view, and o&rsquo;er the front<br/>
There seem&rsquo;d to be besprent a deal of gilding<br/>
    And various hues, as is the Turkish wont,&mdash;<br/>
A gaudy taste; for they are little skill&rsquo;d in<br/>
    The arts of which these lands were once the font:<br/>
Each villa on the Bosphorus looks a screen<br/>
New painted, or a pretty opera-scene.<br/>
<br/>
And nearer as they came, a genial savour<br/>
    Of certain stews, and roast-meats, and pilaus,<br/>
Things which in hungry mortals&rsquo; eyes find favour,<br/>
    Made Juan in his harsh intentions pause,<br/>
And put himself upon his good behaviour:<br/>
    His friend, too, adding a new saving clause,<br/>
Said, &lsquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name let&rsquo;s get some supper now,<br/>
And then I&rsquo;m with you, if you&rsquo;re for a row.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Some talk of an appeal unto some passion,<br/>
    Some to men&rsquo;s feelings, others to their reason;<br/>
The last of these was never much the fashion,<br/>
    For reason thinks all reasoning out of season.<br/>
Some speakers whine, and others lay the lash on,<br/>
    But more or less continue still to tease on,<br/>
With arguments according to their &lsquo;forte;&rsquo;<br/>
But no one dreams of ever being short.-<br/>
<br/>
But I digress: of all appeals,&mdash;although<br/>
    I grant the power of pathos, and of gold,<br/>
Of beauty, flattery, threats, a shilling,&mdash;no<br/>
    Method &rsquo;s more sure at moments to take hold<br/>
Of the best feelings of mankind, which grow<br/>
    More tender, as we every day behold,<br/>
Than that all-softening, overpowering knell,<br/>
The tocsin of the soul&mdash;the dinner-bell.<br/>
<br/>
Turkey contains no bells, and yet men dine;<br/>
    And Juan and his friend, albeit they heard<br/>
No Christian knoll to table, saw no line<br/>
    Of lackeys usher to the feast prepared,<br/>
Yet smelt roast-meat, beheld a huge fire shine,<br/>
    And cooks in motion with their clean arms bared,<br/>
And gazed around them to the left and right<br/>
With the prophetic eye of appetite.<br/>
<br/>
And giving up all notions of resistance,<br/>
    They follow&rsquo;d close behind their sable guide,<br/>
Who little thought that his own crack&rsquo;d existence<br/>
    Was on the point of being set aside:<br/>
He motion&rsquo;d them to stop at some small distance,<br/>
    And knocking at the gate, &rsquo;twas open&rsquo;d wide,<br/>
And a magnificent large hall display&rsquo;d<br/>
The Asian pomp of Ottoman parade.<br/>
<br/>
I won&rsquo;t describe; description is my forte,<br/>
    But every fool describes in these bright days<br/>
His wondrous journey to some foreign court,<br/>
    And spawns his quarto, and demands your praise&mdash;<br/>
Death to his publisher, to him &rsquo;tis sport;<br/>
    While Nature, tortured twenty thousand ways,<br/>
Resigns herself with exemplary patience<br/>
To guide-books, rhymes, tours, sketches, illustrations.<br/>
<br/>
Along this hall, and up and down, some, squatted<br/>
    Upon their hams, were occupied at chess;<br/>
Others in monosyllable talk chatted,<br/>
    And some seem&rsquo;d much in love with their own dress.<br/>
And divers smoked superb pipes decorated<br/>
    With amber mouths of greater price or less;<br/>
And several strutted, others slept, and some<br/>
Prepared for supper with a glass of rum.<br/>
<br/>
As the black eunuch enter&rsquo;d with his brace<br/>
    Of purchased Infidels, some raised their eyes<br/>
A moment without slackening from their pace;<br/>
    But those who sate ne&rsquo;er stirr&rsquo;d in anywise:<br/>
One or two stared the captives in the face,<br/>
    Just as one views a horse to guess his price;<br/>
Some nodded to the negro from their station,<br/>
But no one troubled him with conversation.<br/>
<br/>
He leads them through the hall, and, without stopping,<br/>
    On through a farther range of goodly rooms,<br/>
Splendid but silent, save in one, where, dropping,<br/>
    A marble fountain echoes through the glooms<br/>
Of night which robe the chamber, or where popping<br/>
    Some female head most curiously presumes<br/>
To thrust its black eyes through the door or lattice,<br/>
As wondering what the devil a noise that is.<br/>
<br/>
Some faint lamps gleaming from the lofty walls<br/>
    Gave light enough to hint their farther way,<br/>
But not enough to show the imperial halls,<br/>
    In all the flashing of their full array;<br/>
Perhaps there&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not say appals,<br/>
    But saddens more by night as well as day,<br/>
Than an enormous room without a soul<br/>
To break the lifeless splendour of the whole.<br/>
<br/>
Two or three seem so little, one seems nothing:<br/>
    In deserts, forests, crowds, or by the shore,<br/>
There solitude, we know, has her full growth in<br/>
    The spots which were her realms for evermore;<br/>
But in a mighty hall or gallery, both in<br/>
    More modern buildings and those built of yore,<br/>
A kind of death comes o&rsquo;er us all alone,<br/>
Seeing what &rsquo;s meant for many with but one.<br/>
<br/>
A neat, snug study on a winter&rsquo;s night,<br/>
    A book, friend, single lady, or a glass<br/>
Of claret, sandwich, and an appetite,<br/>
    Are things which make an English evening pass;<br/>
Though certes by no means so grand a sight<br/>
    As is a theatre lit up by gas.<br/>
I pass my evenings in long galleries solely,<br/>
And that &rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;m so melancholy.<br/>
<br/>
Alas! man makes that great which makes him little:<br/>
    I grant you in a church &rsquo;tis very well:<br/>
What speaks of Heaven should by no means be brittle,<br/>
    But strong and lasting, till no tongue can tell<br/>
Their names who rear&rsquo;d it; but huge houses fit ill&mdash;<br/>
    And huge tombs worse&mdash;mankind, since Adam fell:<br/>
Methinks the story of the tower of Babel<br/>
Might teach them this much better than I&rsquo;m able.<br/>
<br/>
Babel was Nimrod&rsquo;s hunting-box, and then<br/>
    A town of gardens, walls, and wealth amazing,<br/>
Where Nabuchadonosor, king of men,<br/>
    Reign&rsquo;d, till one summer&rsquo;s day he took to grazing,<br/>
And Daniel tamed the lions in their den,<br/>
    The people&rsquo;s awe and admiration raising;<br/>
&rsquo;Twas famous, too, for Thisbe and for Pyramus,<br/>
And the calumniated queen Semiramis.<br/>
<br/>
That injured Queen by chroniclers so coarse<br/>
    Has been accused (I doubt not by conspiracy)<br/>
Of an improper friendship for her horse<br/>
    (Love, like religion, sometimes runs to heresy):<br/>
This monstrous tale had probably its source<br/>
    (For such exaggerations here and there I see)<br/>
In writing &lsquo;Courser&rsquo; by mistake for &lsquo;Courier:&rsquo;<br/>
I wish the case could come before a jury here.<br/>
<br/>
But to resume,&mdash;should there be (what may not<br/>
    Be in these days?) some infidels, who don&rsquo;t,<br/>
Because they can&rsquo;t find out the very spot<br/>
    Of that same Babel, or because they won&rsquo;t<br/>
(Though Claudius Rich, Esquire, some bricks has got,<br/>
    And written lately two memoirs upon&rsquo;t),<br/>
Believe the Jews, those unbelievers, who<br/>
Must be believed, though they believe not you,<br/>
<br/>
Yet let them think that Horace has exprest<br/>
    Shortly and sweetly the masonic folly<br/>
Of those, forgetting the great place of rest,<br/>
    Who give themselves to architecture wholly;<br/>
We know where things and men must end at best:<br/>
    A moral (like all morals) melancholy,<br/>
And &lsquo;Et sepulchri immemor struis domos&rsquo;<br/>
Shows that we build when we should but entomb us.<br/>
<br/>
At last they reach&rsquo;d a quarter most retired,<br/>
    Where echo woke as if from a long slumber;<br/>
Though full of all things which could be desired,<br/>
    One wonder&rsquo;d what to do with such a number<br/>
Of articles which nobody required;<br/>
    Here wealth had done its utmost to encumber<br/>
With furniture an exquisite apartment,<br/>
Which puzzled Nature much to know what Art meant.<br/>
<br/>
It seem&rsquo;d, however, but to open on<br/>
    A range or suite of further chambers, which<br/>
Might lead to heaven knows where; but in this one<br/>
    The movables were prodigally rich:<br/>
Sofas &rsquo;twas half a sin to sit upon,<br/>
    So costly were they; carpets every stitch<br/>
Of workmanship so rare, they made you wish<br/>
You could glide o&rsquo;er them like a golden fish.<br/>
<br/>
The black, however, without hardly deigning<br/>
    A glance at that which wrapt the slaves in wonder,<br/>
Trampled what they scarce trod for fear of staining,<br/>
    As if the milky way their feet was under<br/>
With all its stars; and with a stretch attaining<br/>
    A certain press or cupboard niched in yonder&mdash;<br/>
In that remote recess which you may see&mdash;<br/>
Or if you don&rsquo;t the fault is not in me,&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
I wish to be perspicuous; and the black,<br/>
    I say, unlocking the recess, pull&rsquo;d forth<br/>
A quantity of clothes fit for the back<br/>
    Of any Mussulman, whate&rsquo;er his worth;<br/>
And of variety there was no lack&mdash;<br/>
    And yet, though I have said there was no dearth,<br/>
He chose himself to point out what he thought<br/>
Most proper for the Christians he had bought.<br/>
<br/>
The suit he thought most suitable to each<br/>
    Was, for the elder and the stouter, first<br/>
A Candiote cloak, which to the knee might reach,<br/>
    And trousers not so tight that they would burst,<br/>
But such as fit an Asiatic breech;<br/>
    A shawl, whose folds in Cashmire had been nurst,<br/>
Slippers of saffron, dagger rich and handy;<br/>
In short, all things which form a Turkish Dandy.<br/>
<br/>
While he was dressing, Baba, their black friend,<br/>
    Hinted the vast advantages which they<br/>
Might probably attain both in the end,<br/>
    If they would but pursue the proper way<br/>
Which fortune plainly seem&rsquo;d to recommend;<br/>
    And then he added, that he needs must say,<br/>
&lsquo;&rsquo;Twould greatly tend to better their condition,<br/>
If they would condescend to circumcision.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;For his own part, he really should rejoice<br/>
    To see them true believers, but no less<br/>
Would leave his proposition to their choice.&rsquo;<br/>
    The other, thanking him for this excess<br/>
Of goodness, in thus leaving them a voice<br/>
    In such a trifle, scarcely could express<br/>
&lsquo;Sufficiently&rsquo; (he said) &lsquo;his approbation<br/>
Of all the customs of this polish&rsquo;d nation.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;For his own share&mdash;he saw but small objection<br/>
    To so respectable an ancient rite;<br/>
And, after swallowing down a slight refection,<br/>
    For which he own&rsquo;d a present appetite,<br/>
He doubted not a few hours of reflection<br/>
    Would reconcile him to the business quite.&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;Will it?&rsquo; said Juan, sharply: &lsquo;Strike me dead,<br/>
But they as soon shall circumcise my head!<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Cut off a thousand heads, before-&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Now, pray,&rsquo;<br/>
    Replied the other, &lsquo;do not interrupt:<br/>
You put me out in what I had to say.<br/>
    Sir!&mdash;as I said, as soon as I have supt,<br/>
I shall perpend if your proposal may<br/>
    Be such as I can properly accept;<br/>
Provided always your great goodness still<br/>
Remits the matter to our own free-will.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Baba eyed Juan, and said, &lsquo;Be so good<br/>
    As dress yourself-&rsquo; and pointed out a suit<br/>
In which a Princess with great pleasure would<br/>
    Array her limbs; but Juan standing mute,<br/>
As not being in a masquerading mood,<br/>
    Gave it a slight kick with his Christian foot;<br/>
And when the old negro told him to &lsquo;Get ready,&rsquo;<br/>
Replied, &lsquo;Old gentleman, I&rsquo;m not a lady.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;What you may be, I neither know nor care,&rsquo;<br/>
    Said Baba; &lsquo;but pray do as I desire:<br/>
I have no more time nor many words to spare.&rsquo;<br/>
    &lsquo;At least,&rsquo; said Juan, &lsquo;sure I may enquire<br/>
The cause of this odd travesty?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Forbear,&rsquo;<br/>
    Said Baba, &lsquo;to be curious; &rsquo;twill transpire,<br/>
No doubt, in proper place, and time, and season:<br/>
I have no authority to tell the reason.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Then if I do,&rsquo; said Juan, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be-&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Hold!&rsquo;<br/>
    Rejoin&rsquo;d the negro, &lsquo;pray be not provoking;<br/>
This spirit &rsquo;s well, but it may wax too bold,<br/>
    And you will find us not top fond of joking.&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;What, sir!&rsquo; said Juan, &lsquo;shall it e&rsquo;er be told<br/>
    That I unsex&rsquo;d my dress?&rsquo; But Baba, stroking<br/>
The things down, said, &lsquo;Incense me, and I call<br/>
Those who will leave you of no sex at all.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;I offer you a handsome suit of clothes:<br/>
    A woman&rsquo;s, true; but then there is a cause<br/>
Why you should wear them.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What, though my soul loathes<br/>
    The effeminate garb?&rsquo;&mdash;thus, after a short pause,<br/>
Sigh&rsquo;d Juan, muttering also some slight oaths,<br/>
    &lsquo;What the devil shall I do with all this gauze?&rsquo;<br/>
Thus he profanely term&rsquo;d the finest lace<br/>
Which e&rsquo;er set off a marriage-morning face.<br/>
<br/>
And then he swore; and, sighing, on he slipp&rsquo;d<br/>
    A pair of trousers of flesh-colour&rsquo;d silk;<br/>
Next with a virgin zone he was equipp&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Which girt a slight chemise as white as milk;<br/>
But tugging on his petticoat, he tripp&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Which&mdash;as we say&mdash;or, as the Scotch say, whilk<br/>
(The rhyme obliges me to this; sometimes<br/>
Monarchs are less imperative than rhymes)&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Whilk, which (or what you please), was owing to<br/>
    His garment&rsquo;s novelty, and his being awkward:<br/>
And yet at last he managed to get through<br/>
    His toilet, though no doubt a little backward:<br/>
The negro Baba help&rsquo;d a little too,<br/>
    When some untoward part of raiment stuck hard;<br/>
And, wrestling both his arms into a gown,<br/>
He paused, and took a survey up and down.<br/>
<br/>
One difficulty still remain&rsquo;d&mdash;his hair<br/>
    Was hardly long enough; but Baba found<br/>
So many false long tresses all to spare,<br/>
    That soon his head was most completely crown&rsquo;d,<br/>
After the manner then in fashion there;<br/>
    And this addition with such gems was bound<br/>
As suited the ensemble of his toilet,<br/>
While Baba made him comb his head and oil it.<br/>
<br/>
And now being femininely all array&rsquo;d,<br/>
    With some small aid from scissors, paint, and tweezers,<br/>
He look&rsquo;d in almost all respects a maid,<br/>
    And Baba smilingly exclaim&rsquo;d, &lsquo;You see, sirs,<br/>
A perfect transformation here display&rsquo;d;<br/>
    And now, then, you must come along with me, sirs,<br/>
That is&mdash;the Lady:&rsquo; clapping his hands twice,<br/>
Four blacks were at his elbow in a trice.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;You, sir,&rsquo; said Baba, nodding to the one,<br/>
    &lsquo;Will please to accompany those gentlemen<br/>
To supper; but you, worthy Christian nun,<br/>
    Will follow me: no trifling, sir; for when<br/>
I say a thing, it must at once be done.<br/>
    What fear you? think you this a lion&rsquo;s den?<br/>
Why, &rsquo;tis a palace; where the truly wise<br/>
Anticipate the Prophet&rsquo;s paradise.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;You fool! I tell you no one means you harm.&rsquo;<br/>
    &lsquo;So much the better,&rsquo; Juan said, &lsquo;for them;<br/>
Else they shall feel the weight of this my arm,<br/>
    Which is not quite so light as you may deem.<br/>
I yield thus far; but soon will break the charm<br/>
    If any take me for that which I seem:<br/>
So that I trust for everybody&rsquo;s sake,<br/>
That this disguise may lead to no mistake.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Blockhead! come on, and see,&rsquo; quoth Baba; while<br/>
    Don Juan, turning to his comrade, who<br/>
Though somewhat grieved, could scarce forbear a smile<br/>
    Upon the metamorphosis in view,&mdash;<br/>
&lsquo;Farewell!&rsquo; they mutually exclaim&rsquo;d: &lsquo;this soil<br/>
    Seems fertile in adventures strange and new;<br/>
One &rsquo;s turn&rsquo;d half Mussulman, and one a maid,<br/>
By this old black enchanter&rsquo;s unsought aid.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Farewell!&rsquo; said Juan: &lsquo;should we meet no more,<br/>
    I wish you a good appetite.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Farewell!&rsquo;<br/>
Replied the other; &lsquo;though it grieves me sore;<br/>
    When we next meet we&rsquo;ll have a tale to tell:<br/>
We needs must follow when Fate puts from shore.<br/>
    Keep your good name; though Eve herself once fell.&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; quoth the maid, &lsquo;the Sultan&rsquo;s self shan&rsquo;t carry me,<br/>
Unless his highness promises to marry me.<br/>
<br/>
And thus they parted, each by separate doors;<br/>
    Baba led Juan onward room by room<br/>
Through glittering galleries and o&rsquo;er marble floors,<br/>
    Till a gigantic portal through the gloom,<br/>
Haughty and huge, along the distance lowers;<br/>
    And wafted far arose a rich perfume:<br/>
It seem&rsquo;d as though they came upon a shrine,<br/>
For all was vast, still, fragrant, and divine.<br/>
<br/>
The giant door was broad, and bright, and high,<br/>
    Of gilded bronze, and carved in curious guise;<br/>
Warriors thereon were battling furiously;<br/>
    Here stalks the victor, there the vanquish&rsquo;d lies;<br/>
There captives led in triumph droop the eye,<br/>
    And in perspective many a squadron flies:<br/>
It seems the work of times before the line<br/>
Of Rome transplanted fell with Constantine.<br/>
<br/>
This massy portal stood at the wide close<br/>
    Of a huge hall, and on its either side<br/>
Two little dwarfs, the least you could suppose,<br/>
    Were sate, like ugly imps, as if allied<br/>
In mockery to the enormous gate which rose<br/>
    O&rsquo;er them in almost pyramidic pride:<br/>
The gate so splendid was in all its features,<br/>
You never thought about those little creatures,<br/>
<br/>
Until you nearly trod on them, and then<br/>
    You started back in horror to survey<br/>
The wondrous hideousness of those small men,<br/>
    Whose colour was not black, nor white, nor grey,<br/>
But an extraneous mixture, which no pen<br/>
    Can trace, although perhaps the pencil may;<br/>
They were mis-shapen pigmies, deaf and dumb&mdash;<br/>
Monsters, who cost a no less monstrous sum.<br/>
<br/>
Their duty was&mdash;for they were strong, and though<br/>
    They look&rsquo;d so little, did strong things at times&mdash;<br/>
To ope this door, which they could really do,<br/>
    The hinges being as smooth as Rogers&rsquo; rhymes;<br/>
And now and then, with tough strings of the bow,<br/>
    As is the custom of those Eastern climes,<br/>
To give some rebel Pacha a cravat;<br/>
For mutes are generally used for that.<br/>
<br/>
They spoke by signs&mdash;that is, not spoke at all;<br/>
    And looking like two incubi, they glared<br/>
As Baba with his fingers made them fall<br/>
    To heaving back the portal folds: it scared<br/>
Juan a moment, as this pair so small<br/>
    With shrinking serpent optics on him stared;<br/>
It was as if their little looks could poison<br/>
Or fascinate whome&rsquo;er they fix&rsquo;d their eyes on.<br/>
<br/>
Before they enter&rsquo;d, Baba paused to hint<br/>
    To Juan some slight lessons as his guide:<br/>
&lsquo;If you could just contrive,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to stint<br/>
    That somewhat manly majesty of stride,<br/>
&rsquo;Twould be as well, and (though there&rsquo;s not much in &rsquo;t)<br/>
    To swing a little less from side to side,<br/>
Which has at times an aspect of the oddest;&mdash;<br/>
And also could you look a little modest,<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;&rsquo;Twould be convenient; for these mutes have eyes<br/>
    Like needles, which may pierce those petticoats;<br/>
And if they should discover your disguise,<br/>
    You know how near us the deep Bosphorus floats;<br/>
And you and I may chance, ere morning rise,<br/>
    To find our way to Marmora without boats,<br/>
Stitch&rsquo;d up in sacks&mdash;a mode of navigation<br/>
A good deal practised here upon occasion.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
With this encouragement, he led the way<br/>
    Into a room still nobler than the last;<br/>
A rich confusion form&rsquo;d a disarray<br/>
    In such sort, that the eye along it cast<br/>
Could hardly carry anything away,<br/>
    Object on object flash&rsquo;d so bright and fast;<br/>
A dazzling mass of gems, and gold, and glitter,<br/>
Magnificently mingled in a litter.<br/>
<br/>
Wealth had done wonders&mdash;taste not much; such things<br/>
    Occur in Orient palaces, and even<br/>
In the more chasten&rsquo;d domes of Western kings<br/>
    (Of which I have also seen some six or seven),<br/>
Where I can&rsquo;t say or gold or diamond flings<br/>
    Great lustre, there is much to be forgiven;<br/>
Groups of bad statues, tables, chairs, and pictures,<br/>
On which I cannot pause to make my strictures.<br/>
<br/>
In this imperial hall, at distance lay<br/>
    Under a canopy, and there reclined<br/>
Quite in a confidential queenly way,<br/>
    A lady; Baba stopp&rsquo;d, and kneeling sign&rsquo;d<br/>
To Juan, who though not much used to pray,<br/>
    Knelt down by instinct, wondering in his mind,<br/>
What all this meant: while Baba bow&rsquo;d and bended<br/>
His head, until the ceremony ended.<br/>
<br/>
The lady rising up with such an air<br/>
    As Venus rose with from the wave, on them<br/>
Bent like an antelope a Paphian pair<br/>
    Of eyes, which put out each surrounding gem;<br/>
And raising up an arm as moonlight fair,<br/>
    She sign&rsquo;d to Baba, who first kiss&rsquo;d the hem<br/>
Of her deep purple robe, and speaking low,<br/>
Pointed to Juan who remain&rsquo;d below.<br/>
<br/>
Her presence was as lofty as her state;<br/>
    Her beauty of that overpowering kind,<br/>
Whose force description only would abate:<br/>
    I&rsquo;d rather leave it much to your own mind,<br/>
Than lessen it by what I could relate<br/>
    Of forms and features; it would strike you blind<br/>
Could I do justice to the full detail;<br/>
So, luckily for both, my phrases fail.<br/>
<br/>
Thus much however I may add,&mdash;her years<br/>
    Were ripe, they might make six-and-twenty springs;<br/>
But there are forms which Time to touch forbears,<br/>
    And turns aside his scythe to vulgar things,<br/>
Such as was Mary&rsquo;s Queen of Scots; true&mdash;tears<br/>
    And love destroy; and sapping sorrow wrings<br/>
Charms from the charmer, yet some never grow<br/>
Ugly; for instance&mdash;Ninon de l&rsquo;Enclos.<br/>
<br/>
She spake some words to her attendants, who<br/>
    Composed a choir of girls, ten or a dozen,<br/>
And were all clad alike; like Juan, too,<br/>
    Who wore their uniform, by Baba chosen;<br/>
They form&rsquo;d a very nymph-like looking crew,<br/>
    Which might have call&rsquo;d Diana&rsquo;s chorus &lsquo;cousin,&rsquo;<br/>
As far as outward show may correspond;<br/>
I won&rsquo;t be bail for anything beyond.<br/>
<br/>
They bow&rsquo;d obeisance and withdrew, retiring,<br/>
    But not by the same door through which came in<br/>
Baba and Juan, which last stood admiring,<br/>
    At some small distance, all he saw within<br/>
This strange saloon, much fitted for inspiring<br/>
    Marvel and praise; for both or none things win;<br/>
And I must say, I ne&rsquo;er could see the very<br/>
Great happiness of the &lsquo;Nil Admirari.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Not to admire is all the art I know<br/>
    (Plain truth, dear Murray, needs few flowers of speech)<br/>
To make men happy, or to keep them so&rsquo;<br/>
    (So take it in the very words of Creech)&mdash;<br/>
Thus Horace wrote we all know long ago;<br/>
    And thus Pope quotes the precept to re-teach<br/>
From his translation; but had none admired,<br/>
Would Pope have sung, or Horace been inspired?<br/>
<br/>
Baba, when all the damsels were withdrawn,<br/>
    Motion&rsquo;d to Juan to approach, and then<br/>
A second time desired him to kneel down,<br/>
    And kiss the lady&rsquo;s foot; which maxim when<br/>
He heard repeated, Juan with a frown<br/>
    Drew himself up to his full height again,<br/>
And said, &lsquo;It grieved him, but he could not stoop<br/>
To any shoe, unless it shod the Pope.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Baba, indignant at this ill-timed pride,<br/>
    Made fierce remonstrances, and then a threat<br/>
He mutter&rsquo;d (but the last was given aside)<br/>
    About a bow-string&mdash;quite in vain; not yet<br/>
Would Juan bend, though &rsquo;twere to Mahomet&rsquo;s bride:<br/>
    There&rsquo;s nothing in the world like etiquette<br/>
In kingly chambers or imperial halls,<br/>
As also at the race and county balls.<br/>
<br/>
He stood like Atlas, with a world of words<br/>
    About his ears, and nathless would not bend:<br/>
The blood of all his line &rsquo;s Castilian lords<br/>
    Boil&rsquo;d in his veins, and rather than descend<br/>
To stain his pedigree a thousand swords<br/>
    A thousand times of him had made an end;<br/>
At length perceiving the &lsquo;foot&rsquo; could not stand,<br/>
Baba proposed that he should kiss the hand.<br/>
<br/>
Here was an honourable compromise,<br/>
    A half-way house of diplomatic rest,<br/>
Where they might meet in much more peaceful guise;<br/>
    And Juan now his willingness exprest<br/>
To use all fit and proper courtesies,<br/>
    Adding, that this was commonest and best,<br/>
For through the South the custom still commands<br/>
The gentleman to kiss the lady&rsquo;s hands.<br/>
<br/>
And he advanced, though with but a bad grace,<br/>
    Though on more thorough-bred or fairer fingers<br/>
No lips e&rsquo;er left their transitory trace;<br/>
    On such as these the lip too fondly lingers,<br/>
And for one kiss would fain imprint a brace,<br/>
    As you will see, if she you love shall bring hers<br/>
In contact; and sometimes even a fair stranger&rsquo;s<br/>
An almost twelvemonth&rsquo;s constancy endangers.<br/>
<br/>
The lady eyed him o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er, and bade<br/>
    Baba retire, which he obey&rsquo;d in style,<br/>
As if well used to the retreating trade;<br/>
    And taking hints in good part all the while,<br/>
He whisper&rsquo;d Juan not to be afraid,<br/>
    And looking on him with a sort of smile,<br/>
Took leave, with such a face of satisfaction<br/>
As good men wear who have done a virtuous action.<br/>
<br/>
When he was gone, there was a sudden change:<br/>
    I know not what might be the lady&rsquo;s thought,<br/>
But o&rsquo;er her bright brow flash&rsquo;d a tumult strange,<br/>
    And into her dear cheek the blood was brought,<br/>
Blood-red as sunset summer clouds which range<br/>
    The verge of Heaven; and in her large eyes wrought,<br/>
A mixture of sensations might be scann&rsquo;d,<br/>
Of half voluptuousness and half command.<br/>
<br/>
Her form had all the softness of her sex,<br/>
    Her features all the sweetness of the devil,<br/>
When he put on the cherub to perplex<br/>
    Eve, and paved (God knows how) the road to evil;<br/>
The sun himself was scarce more free from specks<br/>
    Than she from aught at which the eye could cavil;<br/>
Yet, somehow, there was something somewhere wanting,<br/>
As if she rather order&rsquo;d than was granting.<br/>
<br/>
Something imperial, or imperious, threw<br/>
    A chain o&rsquo;er all she did; that is, a chain<br/>
Was thrown as &rsquo;twere about the neck of you,&mdash;<br/>
    And rapture&rsquo;s self will seem almost a pain<br/>
With aught which looks like despotism in view:<br/>
    Our souls at least are free, and &rsquo;tis in vain<br/>
We would against them make the flesh obey&mdash;<br/>
The spirit in the end will have its way.<br/>
<br/>
Her very smile was haughty, though so sweet;<br/>
    Her very nod was not an inclination;<br/>
There was a self-will even in her small feet,<br/>
    As though they were quite conscious of her station&mdash;<br/>
They trod as upon necks; and to complete<br/>
    Her state (it is the custom of her nation),<br/>
A poniard deck&rsquo;d her girdle, as the sign<br/>
She was a sultan&rsquo;s bride (thank Heaven, not mine!).<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;To hear and to obey&rsquo; had been from birth<br/>
    The law of all around her; to fulfill<br/>
All phantasies which yielded joy or mirth,<br/>
    Had been her slaves&rsquo; chief pleasure, as her will;<br/>
Her blood was high, her beauty scarce of earth:<br/>
    Judge, then, if her caprices e&rsquo;er stood still;<br/>
Had she but been a Christian, I&rsquo;ve a notion<br/>
We should have found out the &lsquo;perpetual motion.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Whate&rsquo;er she saw and coveted was brought;<br/>
    Whate&rsquo;er she did not see, if she supposed<br/>
It might be seen, with diligence was sought,<br/>
    And when &rsquo;twas found straightway the bargain closed;<br/>
There was no end unto the things she bought,<br/>
    Nor to the trouble which her fancies caused;<br/>
Yet even her tyranny had such a grace,<br/>
The women pardon&rsquo;d all except her face.<br/>
<br/>
Juan, the latest of her whims, had caught<br/>
    Her eye in passing on his way to sale;<br/>
She order&rsquo;d him directly to be bought,<br/>
    And Baba, who had ne&rsquo;er been known to fail<br/>
In any kind of mischief to be wrought,<br/>
    At all such auctions knew how to prevail:<br/>
She had no prudence, but he had; and this<br/>
Explains the garb which Juan took amiss.<br/>
<br/>
His youth and features favour&rsquo;d the disguise,<br/>
    And, should you ask how she, a sultan&rsquo;s bride,<br/>
Could risk or compass such strange phantasies,<br/>
    This I must leave sultanas to decide:<br/>
Emperors are only husbands in wives&rsquo; eyes,<br/>
    And kings and consorts oft are mystified,<br/>
As we may ascertain with due precision,<br/>
Some by experience, others by tradition.<br/>
<br/>
But to the main point, where we have been tending:&mdash;<br/>
    She now conceived all difficulties past,<br/>
And deem&rsquo;d herself extremely condescending<br/>
    When, being made her property at last,<br/>
Without more preface, in her blue eyes blending<br/>
    Passion and power, a glance on him she cast,<br/>
And merely saying, &lsquo;Christian, canst thou love?&rsquo;<br/>
Conceived that phrase was quite enough to move<br/>
<br/>
And so it was, in proper time and place;<br/>
    But Juan, who had still his mind o&rsquo;erflowing<br/>
With Haidee&rsquo;s isle and soft Ionian face,<br/>
    Felt the warm blood, which in his face was glowing,<br/>
Rush back upon his heart, which fill&rsquo;d apace,<br/>
    And left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing;<br/>
These words went through his soul like Arab-spears,<br/>
So that he spoke not, but burst into tears.<br/>
<br/>
She was a good deal shock&rsquo;d; not shock&rsquo;d at tears,<br/>
    For women shed and use them at their liking;<br/>
But there is something when man&rsquo;s eye appears<br/>
    Wet, still more disagreeable and striking;<br/>
A woman&rsquo;s tear-drop melts, a man&rsquo;s half sears,<br/>
    Like molten lead, as if you thrust a pike in<br/>
His heart to force it out, for (to be shorter)<br/>
To them &rsquo;tis a relief, to us a torture.<br/>
<br/>
And she would have consoled, but knew not how:<br/>
    Having no equals, nothing which had e&rsquo;er<br/>
Infected her with sympathy till now,<br/>
    And never having dreamt what &rsquo;twas to bear<br/>
Aught of a serious, sorrowing kind, although<br/>
    There might arise some pouting petty care<br/>
To cross her brow, she wonder&rsquo;d how so near<br/>
Her eyes another&rsquo;s eye could shed a tear.<br/>
<br/>
But nature teaches more than power can spoil,<br/>
    And, when a strong although a strange sensation<br/>
Moves&mdash;female hearts are such a genial soil<br/>
    For kinder feelings, whatsoe&rsquo;er their nation,<br/>
They naturally pour the &lsquo;wine and oil,&rsquo;<br/>
    Samaritans in every situation;<br/>
And thus Gulbeyaz, though she knew not why,<br/>
Felt an odd glistening moisture in her eye.<br/>
<br/>
But tears must stop like all things else; and soon<br/>
    Juan, who for an instant had been moved<br/>
To such a sorrow by the intrusive tone<br/>
    Of one who dared to ask if &lsquo;he had loved,&rsquo;<br/>
Call&rsquo;d back the stoic to his eyes, which shone<br/>
    Bright with the very weakness he reproved;<br/>
And although sensitive to beauty, he<br/>
Felt most indignant still at not being free.<br/>
<br/>
Gulbeyaz, for the first time in her days,<br/>
    Was much embarrass&rsquo;d, never having met<br/>
In all her life with aught save prayers and praise;<br/>
    And as she also risk&rsquo;d her life to get<br/>
Him whom she meant to tutor in love&rsquo;s ways<br/>
    Into a comfortable tete-a-tete,<br/>
To lose the hour would make her quite a martyr,<br/>
And they had wasted now almost a quarter.<br/>
<br/>
I also would suggest the fitting time<br/>
    To gentlemen in any such like case,<br/>
That is to say in a meridian clime&mdash;<br/>
    With us there is more law given to the chase,<br/>
But here a small delay forms a great crime:<br/>
    So recollect that the extremest grace<br/>
Is just two minutes for your declaration&mdash;<br/>
A moment more would hurt your reputation.<br/>
<br/>
Juan&rsquo;s was good; and might have been still better,<br/>
    But he had got Haidee into his head:<br/>
However strange, he could not yet forget her,<br/>
    Which made him seem exceedingly ill-bred.<br/>
Gulbeyaz, who look&rsquo;d on him as her debtor<br/>
    For having had him to her palace led,<br/>
Began to blush up to the eyes, and then<br/>
Grow deadly pale, and then blush back again.<br/>
<br/>
At length, in an imperial way, she laid<br/>
    Her hand on his, and bending on him eyes<br/>
Which needed not an empire to persuade,<br/>
    Look&rsquo;d into his for love, where none replies:<br/>
Her brow grew black, but she would not upbraid,<br/>
    That being the last thing a proud woman tries;<br/>
She rose, and pausing one chaste moment, threw<br/>
Herself upon his breast, and there she grew.<br/>
<br/>
This was an awkward test, as Juan found,<br/>
    But he was steel&rsquo;d by sorrow, wrath, and pride:<br/>
With gentle force her white arms he unwound,<br/>
    And seated her all drooping by his side,<br/>
Then rising haughtily he glanced around,<br/>
    And looking coldly in her face, he cried,<br/>
&lsquo;The prison&rsquo;d eagle will not pair, nor<br/>
Serve a Sultana&rsquo;s sensual phantasy.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Thou ask&rsquo;st if I can love? be this the proof<br/>
    How much I have loved&mdash;that I love not thee!<br/>
In this vile garb, the distaff, web, and woof,<br/>
    Were fitter for me: Love is for the free!<br/>
I am not dazzled by this splendid roof,<br/>
    Whate&rsquo;er thy power, and great it seems to be;<br/>
Heads bow, knees bend, eyes watch around a throne,<br/>
And hands obey&mdash;our hearts are still our own.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
This was a truth to us extremely trite;<br/>
    Not so to her, who ne&rsquo;er had heard such things:<br/>
She deem&rsquo;d her least command must yield delight,<br/>
    Earth being only made for queens and kings.<br/>
If hearts lay on the left side or the right<br/>
    She hardly knew, to such perfection brings<br/>
Legitimacy its born votaries, when<br/>
Aware of their due royal rights o&rsquo;er men.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, as has been said, she was so fair<br/>
    As even in a much humbler lot had made<br/>
A kingdom or confusion anywhere,<br/>
    And also, as may be presumed, she laid<br/>
Some stress on charms, which seldom are, if e&rsquo;er,<br/>
    By their possessors thrown into the shade:<br/>
She thought hers gave a double &lsquo;right divine;&rsquo;<br/>
And half of that opinion &rsquo;s also mine.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, or (if you can not) imagine,<br/>
    Ye, who have kept your chastity when young,<br/>
While some more desperate dowager has been waging<br/>
    Love with you, and been in the dog-days stung<br/>
By your refusal, recollect her raging!<br/>
    Or recollect all that was said or sung<br/>
On such a subject; then suppose the face<br/>
Of a young downright beauty in this case.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose,&mdash;but you already have supposed,<br/>
    The spouse of Potiphar, the Lady Booby,<br/>
Phaedra, and all which story has disclosed<br/>
    Of good examples; pity that so few by<br/>
Poets and private tutors are exposed,<br/>
    To educate&mdash;ye youth of Europe&mdash;you by!<br/>
But when you have supposed the few we know,<br/>
You can&rsquo;t suppose Gulbeyaz&rsquo; angry brow.<br/>
<br/>
A tigress robb&rsquo;d of young, a lioness,<br/>
    Or any interesting beast of prey,<br/>
Are similes at hand for the distress<br/>
    Of ladies who can not have their own way;<br/>
But though my turn will not be served with less,<br/>
    These don&rsquo;t express one half what I should say:<br/>
For what is stealing young ones, few or many,<br/>
To cutting short their hopes of having any?<br/>
<br/>
The love of offspring &rsquo;s nature&rsquo;s general law,<br/>
    From tigresses and cubs to ducks and ducklings;<br/>
There&rsquo;s nothing whets the beak, or arms the claw<br/>
    Like an invasion of their babes and sucklings;<br/>
And all who have seen a human nursery, saw<br/>
    How mothers love their children&rsquo;s squalls and chucklings;<br/>
This strong extreme effect (to tire no longer<br/>
Your patience) shows the cause must still be stronger.<br/>
<br/>
If I said fire flash&rsquo;d from Gulbeyaz&rsquo; eyes,<br/>
    &rsquo;Twere nothing&mdash;for her eyes flash&rsquo;d always fire;<br/>
Or said her cheeks assumed the deepest dyes,<br/>
    I should but bring disgrace upon the dyer,<br/>
So supernatural was her passion&rsquo;s rise;<br/>
    For ne&rsquo;er till now she knew a check&rsquo;d desire:<br/>
Even ye who know what a check&rsquo;d woman is<br/>
(Enough, God knows!) would much fall short of this.<br/>
<br/>
Her rage was but a minute&rsquo;s, and &rsquo;twas well&mdash;<br/>
    A moment&rsquo;s more had slain her; but the while<br/>
It lasted &rsquo;twas like a short glimpse of hell:<br/>
    Nought &rsquo;s more sublime than energetic bile,<br/>
Though horrible to see yet grand to tell,<br/>
    Like ocean warring &rsquo;gainst a rocky isle;<br/>
And the deep passions flashing through her form<br/>
Made her a beautiful embodied storm.<br/>
<br/>
A vulgar tempest &rsquo;twere to a typhoon<br/>
    To match a common fury with her rage,<br/>
And yet she did not want to reach the moon,<br/>
    Like moderate Hotspur on the immortal page;<br/>
Her anger pitch&rsquo;d into a lower tune,<br/>
    Perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age&mdash;<br/>
Her wish was but to &lsquo;kill, kill, kill,&rsquo; like Lear&rsquo;s,<br/>
And then her thirst of blood was quench&rsquo;d in tears.<br/>
<br/>
A storm it raged, and like the storm it pass&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Pass&rsquo;d without words&mdash;in fact she could not speak;<br/>
And then her sex&rsquo;s shame broke in at last,<br/>
    A sentiment till then in her but weak,<br/>
But now it flow&rsquo;d in natural and fast,<br/>
    As water through an unexpected leak;<br/>
For she felt humbled&mdash;and humiliation<br/>
Is sometimes good for people in her station<br/>
<br/>
It teaches them that they are flesh and blood,<br/>
    It also gently hints to them that others,<br/>
Although of clay, are yet not quite of mud;<br/>
    That urns and pipkins are but fragile brothers,<br/>
And works of the same pottery, bad or good,<br/>
    Though not all born of the same sires and mothers:<br/>
It teaches&mdash;Heaven knows only what it teaches,<br/>
But sometimes it may mend, and often reaches.<br/>
<br/>
Her first thought was to cut off Juan&rsquo;s head;<br/>
    Her second, to cut only his&mdash;acquaintance;<br/>
Her third, to ask him where he had been bred;<br/>
    Her fourth, to rally him into repentance;<br/>
Her fifth, to call her maids and go to bed;<br/>
    Her sixth, to stab herself; her seventh, to sentence<br/>
The lash to Baba:&mdash;but her grand resource<br/>
Was to sit down again, and cry of course.<br/>
<br/>
She thought to stab herself, but then she had<br/>
    The dagger close at hand, which made it awkward;<br/>
For Eastern stays are little made to pad,<br/>
    So that a poniard pierces if &rsquo;tis stuck hard:<br/>
She thought of killing Juan&mdash;but, poor lad!<br/>
    Though he deserved it well for being so backward,<br/>
The cutting off his head was not the art<br/>
Most likely to attain her aim&mdash;his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Juan was moved; he had made up his mind<br/>
    To be impaled, or quarter&rsquo;d as a dish<br/>
For dogs, or to be slain with pangs refined,<br/>
    Or thrown to lions, or made baits for fish,<br/>
And thus heroically stood resign&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Rather than sin&mdash;except to his own wish:<br/>
But all his great preparatives for dying<br/>
Dissolved like snow before a woman crying.<br/>
<br/>
As through his palms Bob Acres&rsquo; valour oozed,<br/>
    So Juan&rsquo;s virtue ebb&rsquo;d, I know not how;<br/>
And first he wonder&rsquo;d why he had refused;<br/>
    And then, if matters could be made up now;<br/>
And next his savage virtue he accused,<br/>
    Just as a friar may accuse his vow,<br/>
Or as a dame repents her of her oath,<br/>
Which mostly ends in some small breach of both.<br/>
<br/>
So he began to stammer some excuses;<br/>
    But words are not enough in such a matter,<br/>
Although you borrow&rsquo;d all that e&rsquo;er the muses<br/>
    Have sung, or even a Dandy&rsquo;s dandiest chatter,<br/>
Or all the figures Castlereagh abuses;<br/>
    Just as a languid smile began to flatter<br/>
His peace was making, but before he ventured<br/>
Further, old Baba rather briskly enter&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Bride of the Sun! and Sister of the Moon!&rsquo;<br/>
    (&rsquo;Twas thus he spake) &lsquo;and Empress of the Earth!<br/>
Whose frown would put the spheres all out of tune,<br/>
    Whose smile makes all the planets dance with mirth,<br/>
Your slave brings tidings&mdash;he hopes not too soon&mdash;<br/>
    Which your sublime attention may be worth:<br/>
The Sun himself has sent me like a ray,<br/>
To hint that he is coming up this way.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Is it,&rsquo; exclaim&rsquo;d Gulbeyaz, &lsquo;as you say?<br/>
    I wish to heaven he would not shine till morning!<br/>
But bid my women form the milky way.<br/>
    Hence, my old comet! give the stars due warning&mdash;<br/>
And, Christian! mingle with them as you may,<br/>
    And as you&rsquo;d have me pardon your past scorning-&rsquo;<br/>
Here they were interrupted by a humming<br/>
Sound, and then by a cry, &lsquo;The Sultan &rsquo;s coming!&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
First came her damsels, a decorous file,<br/>
    And then his Highness&rsquo; eunuchs, black and white;<br/>
The train might reach a quarter of a mile:<br/>
    His majesty was always so polite<br/>
As to announce his visits a long while<br/>
    Before he came, especially at night;<br/>
For being the last wife of the Emperour,<br/>
She was of course the favorite of the four.<br/>
<br/>
His Highness was a man of solemn port,<br/>
    Shawl&rsquo;d to the nose, and bearded to the eyes,<br/>
Snatch&rsquo;d from a prison to preside at court,<br/>
    His lately bowstrung brother caused his rise;<br/>
He was as good a sovereign of the sort<br/>
    As any mention&rsquo;d in the histories<br/>
Of Cantemir, or Knolles, where few shine<br/>
Save Solyman, the glory of their line.<br/>
<br/>
He went to mosque in state, and said his prayers<br/>
    With more than &lsquo;Oriental scrupulosity;&rsquo;<br/>
He left to his vizier all state affairs,<br/>
    And show&rsquo;d but little royal curiosity:<br/>
I know not if he had domestic cares&mdash;<br/>
    No process proved connubial animosity;<br/>
Four wives and twice five hundred maids, unseen,<br/>
Were ruled as calmly as a Christian queen.<br/>
<br/>
If now and then there happen&rsquo;d a slight slip,<br/>
    Little was heard of criminal or crime;<br/>
The story scarcely pass&rsquo;d a single lip&mdash;<br/>
    The sack and sea had settled all in time,<br/>
From which the secret nobody could rip:<br/>
    The Public knew no more than does this rhyme;<br/>
No scandals made the daily press a curse&mdash;<br/>
Morals were better, and the fish no worse.<br/>
<br/>
He saw with his own eyes the moon was round,<br/>
    Was also certain that the earth was square,<br/>
Because he had journey&rsquo;d fifty miles, and found<br/>
    No sign that it was circular anywhere;<br/>
His empire also was without a bound:<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis true, a little troubled here and there,<br/>
By rebel pachas, and encroaching giaours,<br/>
But then they never came to &lsquo;the Seven Towers;&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Except in shape of envoys, who were sent<br/>
    To lodge there when a war broke out, according<br/>
To the true law of nations, which ne&rsquo;er meant<br/>
    Those scoundrels, who have never had a sword in<br/>
Their dirty diplomatic hands, to vent<br/>
    Their spleen in making strife, and safely wording<br/>
Their lies, yclep&rsquo;d despatches, without risk or<br/>
The singeing of a single inky whisker.<br/>
<br/>
He had fifty daughters and four dozen sons,<br/>
    Of whom all such as came of age were stow&rsquo;d,<br/>
The former in a palace, where like nuns<br/>
    They lived till some Bashaw was sent abroad,<br/>
When she, whose turn it was, was wed at once,<br/>
    Sometimes at six years old&mdash;though it seems odd,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis true; the reason is, that the Bashaw<br/>
Must make a present to his sire in law.<br/>
<br/>
His sons were kept in prison, till they grew<br/>
    Of years to fill a bowstring or the throne,<br/>
One or the other, but which of the two<br/>
    Could yet be known unto the fates alone;<br/>
Meantime the education they went through<br/>
    Was princely, as the proofs have always shown:<br/>
So that the heir apparent still was found<br/>
No less deserving to be hang&rsquo;d than crown&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
His majesty saluted his fourth spouse<br/>
    With all the ceremonies of his rank,<br/>
Who clear&rsquo;d her sparkling eyes and smooth&rsquo;d her brows,<br/>
    As suits a matron who has play&rsquo;d a prank;<br/>
These must seem doubly mindful of their vows,<br/>
    To save the credit of their breaking bank:<br/>
To no men are such cordial greetings given<br/>
As those whose wives have made them fit for heaven.<br/>
<br/>
His Highness cast around his great black eyes,<br/>
    And looking, as he always look&rsquo;d, perceived<br/>
Juan amongst the damsels in disguise,<br/>
    At which he seem&rsquo;d no whit surprised nor grieved,<br/>
But just remark&rsquo;d with air sedate and wise,<br/>
    While still a fluttering sigh Gulbeyaz heaved,<br/>
&lsquo;I see you&rsquo;ve bought another girl; &rsquo;tis pity<br/>
That a mere Christian should be half so pretty.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
This compliment, which drew all eyes upon<br/>
    The new-bought virgin, made her blush and shake.<br/>
Her comrades, also, thought themselves undone:<br/>
    O! Mahomet! that his majesty should take<br/>
Such notice of a giaour, while scarce to one<br/>
    Of them his lips imperial ever spake!<br/>
There was a general whisper, toss, and wriggle,<br/>
But etiquette forbade them all to giggle.<br/>
<br/>
The Turks do well to shut&mdash;at least, sometimes&mdash;<br/>
    The women up, because, in sad reality,<br/>
Their chastity in these unhappy climes<br/>
    Is not a thing of that astringent quality<br/>
Which in the North prevents precocious crimes,<br/>
    And makes our snow less pure than our morality;<br/>
The sun, which yearly melts the polar ice,<br/>
Has quite the contrary effect on vice.<br/>
<br/>
Thus in the East they are extremely strict,<br/>
    And Wedlock and a Padlock mean the same;<br/>
Excepting only when the former &rsquo;s pick&rsquo;d<br/>
    It ne&rsquo;er can be replaced in proper frame;<br/>
Spoilt, as a pipe of claret is when prick&rsquo;d:<br/>
    But then their own Polygamy &rsquo;s to blame;<br/>
Why don&rsquo;t they knead two virtuous souls for life<br/>
Into that moral centaur, man and wife?<br/>
<br/>
Thus far our chronicle; and now we pause,<br/>
    Though not for want of matter; but &rsquo;tis time<br/>
According to the ancient epic laws,<br/>
    To slacken sail, and anchor with our rhyme.<br/>
Let this fifth canto meet with due applause,<br/>
    The sixth shall have a touch of the sublime;<br/>
Meanwhile, as Homer sometimes sleeps, perhaps<br/>
You&rsquo;ll pardon to my muse a few short naps.<br/>

<h2><a name="2H_4_0007"></a>
CANTO THE SIXTH.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
      &lsquo;There is a tide in the affairs of men<br/>
    Which,&mdash;taken at the flood,&rsquo;&mdash;you know the rest,<br/>
And most of us have found it now and then;<br/>
    At least we think so, though but few have guess&rsquo;d<br/>
The moment, till too late to come again.<br/>
    But no doubt every thing is for the best&mdash;<br/>
Of which the surest sign is in the end:<br/>
When things are at the worst they sometimes mend.<br/>
<br/>
There is a tide in the affairs of women<br/>
    Which, taken at the flood, leads&mdash;God knows where:<br/>
Those navigators must be able seamen<br/>
    Whose charts lay down its current to a hair;<br/>
Not all the reveries of Jacob Behmen<br/>
    With its strange whirls and eddies can compare:<br/>
Men with their heads reflect on this and that&mdash;<br/>
But women with their hearts on heaven knows what!<br/>
<br/>
And yet a headlong, headstrong, downright she,<br/>
    Young, beautiful, and daring&mdash;who would risk<br/>
A throne, the world, the universe, to be<br/>
    Beloved in her own way, and rather whisk<br/>
The stars from out the sky, than not be free<br/>
    As are the billows when the breeze is brisk&mdash;<br/>
Though such a she &rsquo;s a devil (if that there be one),<br/>
Yet she would make full many a Manichean.<br/>
<br/>
Thrones, worlds, et cetera, are so oft upset<br/>
    By commonest ambition, that when passion<br/>
O&rsquo;erthrows the same, we readily forget,<br/>
    Or at the least forgive, the loving rash one.<br/>
If Antony be well remember&rsquo;d yet,<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis not his conquests keep his name in fashion,<br/>
But Actium, lost for Cleopatra&rsquo;s eyes,<br/>
Outbalances all Caesar&rsquo;s victories.<br/>
<br/>
He died at fifty for a queen of forty;<br/>
    I wish their years had been fifteen and twenty,<br/>
For then wealth, kingdoms, worlds are but a sport&mdash;I<br/>
    Remember when, though I had no great plenty<br/>
Of worlds to lose, yet still, to pay my court, I<br/>
    Gave what I had&mdash;a heart: as the world went, I<br/>
Gave what was worth a world; for worlds could never<br/>
Restore me those pure feelings, gone forever.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Twas the boy&rsquo;s &lsquo;mite,&rsquo; and, like the &lsquo;widow&rsquo;s,&rsquo; may<br/>
    Perhaps be weigh&rsquo;d hereafter, if not now;<br/>
But whether such things do or do not weigh,<br/>
    All who have loved, or love, will still allow<br/>
Life has nought like it. God is love, they say,<br/>
    And Love &rsquo;s a god, or was before the brow<br/>
Of earth was wrinkled by the sins and tears<br/>
Of&mdash;but Chronology best knows the years.<br/>
<br/>
We left our hero and third heroine in<br/>
    A kind of state more awkward than uncommon,<br/>
For gentlemen must sometimes risk their skin<br/>
    For that sad tempter, a forbidden woman:<br/>
Sultans too much abhor this sort of sin,<br/>
    And don&rsquo;t agree at all with the wise Roman,<br/>
Heroic, stoic Cato, the sententious,<br/>
Who lent his lady to his friend Hortensius.<br/>
<br/>
I know Gulbeyaz was extremely wrong;<br/>
    I own it, I deplore it, I condemn it;<br/>
But I detest all fiction even in song,<br/>
    And so must tell the truth, howe&rsquo;er you blame it.<br/>
Her reason being weak, her passions strong,<br/>
    She thought that her lord&rsquo;s heart (even could she claim it)<br/>
Was scarce enough; for he had fifty-nine<br/>
Years, and a fifteen-hundredth concubine.<br/>
<br/>
I am not, like Cassio, &lsquo;an arithmetician,&rsquo;<br/>
    But by &lsquo;the bookish theoric&rsquo; it appears,<br/>
If &rsquo;tis summ&rsquo;d up with feminine precision,<br/>
    That, adding to the account his Highness&rsquo; years,<br/>
The fair Sultana err&rsquo;d from inanition;<br/>
    For, were the Sultan just to all his dears,<br/>
She could but claim the fifteen-hundredth part<br/>
Of what should be monopoly&mdash;the heart.<br/>
<br/>
It is observed that ladies are litigious<br/>
    Upon all legal objects of possession,<br/>
And not the least so when they are religious,<br/>
    Which doubles what they think of the transgression:<br/>
With suits and prosecutions they besiege us,<br/>
    As the tribunals show through many a session,<br/>
When they suspect that any one goes shares<br/>
In that to which the law makes them sole heirs.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if this holds good in a Christian land,<br/>
    The heathen also, though with lesser latitude,<br/>
Are apt to carry things with a high hand,<br/>
    And take what kings call &lsquo;an imposing attitude,&rsquo;<br/>
And for their rights connubial make a stand,<br/>
    When their liege husbands treat them with ingratitude:<br/>
And as four wives must have quadruple claims,<br/>
The Tigris hath its jealousies like Thames.<br/>
<br/>
Gulbeyaz was the fourth, and (as I said)<br/>
    The favourite; but what &rsquo;s favour amongst four?<br/>
Polygamy may well be held in dread,<br/>
    Not only as a sin, but as a bore:<br/>
Most wise men, with one moderate woman wed,<br/>
    Will scarcely find philosophy for more;<br/>
And all (except Mahometans) forbear<br/>
To make the nuptial couch a &lsquo;Bed of Ware.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
His Highness, the sublimest of mankind,&mdash;<br/>
    So styled according to the usual forms<br/>
Of every monarch, till they are consign&rsquo;d<br/>
    To those sad hungry jacobins the worms,<br/>
Who on the very loftiest kings have dined,&mdash;<br/>
    His Highness gazed upon Gulbeyaz&rsquo; charms,<br/>
Expecting all the welcome of a lover<br/>
(A &lsquo;Highland welcome&rsquo; all the wide world over).<br/>
<br/>
Now here we should distinguish; for howe&rsquo;er<br/>
    Kisses, sweet words, embraces, and all that,<br/>
May look like what is&mdash;neither here nor there,<br/>
    They are put on as easily as a hat,<br/>
Or rather bonnet, which the fair sex wear,<br/>
    Trimm&rsquo;d either heads or hearts to decorate,<br/>
Which form an ornament, but no more part<br/>
Of heads, than their caresses of the heart.<br/>
<br/>
A slight blush, a soft tremor, a calm kind<br/>
    Of gentle feminine delight, and shown<br/>
More in the eyelids than the eyes, resign&rsquo;d<br/>
    Rather to hide what pleases most unknown,<br/>
Are the best tokens (to a modest mind)<br/>
    Of love, when seated on his loveliest throne,<br/>
A sincere woman&rsquo;s breast,&mdash;for over-warm<br/>
Or over-cold annihilates the charm.<br/>
<br/>
For over-warmth, if false, is worse than truth;<br/>
    If true, &rsquo;tis no great lease of its own fire;<br/>
For no one, save in very early youth,<br/>
    Would like (I think) to trust all to desire,<br/>
Which is but a precarious bond, in sooth,<br/>
    And apt to be transferr&rsquo;d to the first buyer<br/>
At a sad discount: while your over chilly<br/>
Women, on t&rsquo; other hand, seem somewhat silly.<br/>
<br/>
That is, we cannot pardon their bad taste,<br/>
    For so it seems to lovers swift or slow,<br/>
Who fain would have a mutual flame confess&rsquo;d,<br/>
    And see a sentimental passion glow,<br/>
Even were St. Francis&rsquo; paramour their guest,<br/>
    In his monastic concubine of snow;&mdash;<br/>
In short, the maxim for the amorous tribe is<br/>
Horatian, &lsquo;Medio tu tutissimus ibis.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
The &lsquo;tu&rsquo; &rsquo;s too much,&mdash;but let it stand,&mdash;the verse<br/>
    Requires it, that &rsquo;s to say, the English rhyme,<br/>
And not the pink of old hexameters;<br/>
    But, after all, there&rsquo;s neither tune nor time<br/>
In the last line, which cannot well be worse,<br/>
    And was thrust in to close the octave&rsquo;s chime:<br/>
I own no prosody can ever rate it<br/>
As a rule, but truth may, if you translate it.<br/>
<br/>
If fair Gulbeyaz overdid her part,<br/>
    I know not&mdash;it succeeded, and success<br/>
Is much in most things, not less in the heart<br/>
    Than other articles of female dress.<br/>
Self-love in man, too, beats all female art;<br/>
    They lie, we lie, all lie, but love no less;<br/>
And no one virtue yet, except starvation,<br/>
Could stop that worst of vices&mdash;propagation.<br/>
<br/>
We leave this royal couple to repose:<br/>
    A bed is not a throne, and they may sleep,<br/>
Whate&rsquo;er their dreams be, if of joys or woes:<br/>
    Yet disappointed joys are woes as deep<br/>
As any man&rsquo;s day mixture undergoes.<br/>
    Our least of sorrows are such as we weep;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis the vile daily drop on drop which wears<br/>
The soul out (like the stone) with petty cares.<br/>
<br/>
A scolding wife, a sullen son, a bill<br/>
    To pay, unpaid, protested, or discounted<br/>
At a per-centage; a child cross, dog ill,<br/>
    A favourite horse fallen lame just as he &rsquo;s mounted,<br/>
A bad old woman making a worse will,<br/>
    Which leaves you minus of the cash you counted<br/>
As certain;&mdash;these are paltry things, and yet<br/>
I&rsquo;ve rarely seen the man they did not fret.<br/>
<br/>
I&rsquo;m a philosopher; confound them all!<br/>
    Bills, beasts, and men, and&mdash;no! not womankind!<br/>
With one good hearty curse I vent my gall,<br/>
    And then my stoicism leaves nought behind<br/>
Which it can either pain or evil call,<br/>
    And I can give my whole soul up to mind;<br/>
Though what is soul or mind, their birth or growth,<br/>
Is more than I know&mdash;the deuce take them both!<br/>
<br/>
    As after reading Athanasius&rsquo; curse,<br/>
Which doth your true believer so much please:<br/>
    I doubt if any now could make it worse<br/>
O&rsquo;er his worst enemy when at his knees,<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis so sententious, positive, and terse,<br/>
And decorates the book of Common Prayer,<br/>
As doth a rainbow the just clearing air.<br/>
<br/>
Gulbeyaz and her lord were sleeping, or<br/>
    At least one of them!&mdash;Oh, the heavy night,<br/>
When wicked wives, who love some bachelor,<br/>
    Lie down in dudgeon to sigh for the light<br/>
Of the gray morning, and look vainly for<br/>
    Its twinkle through the lattice dusky quite&mdash;<br/>
To toss, to tumble, doze, revive, and quake<br/>
Lest their too lawful bed-fellow should wake!<br/>
<br/>
These are beneath the canopy of heaven,<br/>
    Also beneath the canopy of beds<br/>
Four-posted and silk curtain&rsquo;d, which are given<br/>
    For rich men and their brides to lay their heads<br/>
Upon, in sheets white as what bards call &lsquo;driven<br/>
    Snow.&rsquo; Well! &rsquo;tis all hap-hazard when one weds.<br/>
Gulbeyaz was an empress, but had been<br/>
Perhaps as wretched if a peasant&rsquo;s quean.<br/>
<br/>
Don Juan in his feminine disguise,<br/>
    With all the damsels in their long array,<br/>
Had bow&rsquo;d themselves before th&rsquo; imperial eyes,<br/>
    And at the usual signal ta&rsquo;en their way<br/>
Back to their chambers, those long galleries<br/>
    In the seraglio, where the ladies lay<br/>
Their delicate limbs; a thousand bosoms there<br/>
Beating for love, as the caged bird&rsquo;s for air.<br/>
<br/>
I love the sex, and sometimes would reverse<br/>
    The tyrant&rsquo;s wish, &lsquo;that mankind only had<br/>
One neck, which he with one fell stroke might pierce:&rsquo;<br/>
    My wish is quite as wide, but not so bad,<br/>
And much more tender on the whole than fierce;<br/>
    It being (not now, but only while a lad)<br/>
That womankind had but one rosy mouth,<br/>
To kiss them all at once from North to South.<br/>
<br/>
O, enviable Briareus! with thy hands<br/>
    And heads, if thou hadst all things multiplied<br/>
In such proportion!&mdash;But my Muse withstands<br/>
    The giant thought of being a Titan&rsquo;s bride,<br/>
Or travelling in Patagonian lands;<br/>
    So let us back to Lilliput, and guide<br/>
Our hero through the labyrinth of love<br/>
In which we left him several lines above.<br/>
<br/>
He went forth with the lovely Odalisques,<br/>
    At the given signal join&rsquo;d to their array;<br/>
And though he certainly ran many risks,<br/>
    Yet he could not at times keep, by the way<br/>
(Although the consequences of such frisks<br/>
    Are worse than the worst damages men pay<br/>
In moral England, where the thing &rsquo;s a tax),<br/>
From ogling all their charms from breasts to backs.<br/>
<br/>
Still he forgot not his disguise:&mdash;along<br/>
    The galleries from room to room they walk&rsquo;d,<br/>
A virgin-like and edifying throng,<br/>
    By eunuchs flank&rsquo;d; while at their head there stalk&rsquo;d<br/>
A dame who kept up discipline among<br/>
    The female ranks, so that none stirr&rsquo;d or talk&rsquo;d<br/>
Without her sanction on their she-parades:<br/>
Her title was &lsquo;the Mother of the Maids.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Whether she was a &lsquo;mother,&rsquo; I know not,<br/>
    Or whether they were &lsquo;maids&rsquo; who call&rsquo;d her mother;<br/>
But this is her seraglio title, got<br/>
    I know not how, but good as any other;<br/>
So Cantemir can tell you, or De Tott:<br/>
    Her office was to keep aloof or smother<br/>
All bad propensities in fifteen hundred<br/>
Young women, and correct them when they blunder&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
A goodly sinecure, no doubt! but made<br/>
    More easy by the absence of all men&mdash;<br/>
Except his majesty, who, with her aid,<br/>
    And guards, and bolts, and walls, and now and then<br/>
A slight example, just to cast a shade<br/>
    Along the rest, contrived to keep this den<br/>
Of beauties cool as an Italian convent,<br/>
Where all the passions have, alas! but one vent.<br/>
<br/>
And what is that? Devotion, doubtless&mdash;how<br/>
    Could you ask such a question?&mdash;but we will<br/>
Continue. As I said, this goodly row<br/>
    Of ladies of all countries at the will<br/>
Of one good man, with stately march and slow,<br/>
    Like water-lilies floating down a rill&mdash;<br/>
Or rather lake, for rills do not run slowly&mdash;<br/>
Paced on most maiden-like and melancholy.<br/>
<br/>
But when they reach&rsquo;d their own apartments, there,<br/>
    Like birds, or boys, or bedlamites broke loose,<br/>
Waves at spring-tide, or women anywhere<br/>
    When freed from bonds (which are of no great use<br/>
After all), or like Irish at a fair,<br/>
    Their guards being gone, and as it were a truce<br/>
Establish&rsquo;d between them and bondage, they<br/>
Began to sing, dance, chatter, smile, and play.<br/>
<br/>
Their talk, of course, ran most on the new comer;<br/>
    Her shape, her hair, her air, her everything:<br/>
Some thought her dress did not so much become her,<br/>
    Or wonder&rsquo;d at her ears without a ring;<br/>
Some said her years were getting nigh their summer,<br/>
    Others contended they were but in spring;<br/>
Some thought her rather masculine in height,<br/>
While others wish&rsquo;d that she had been so quite.<br/>
<br/>
But no one doubted on the whole, that she<br/>
    Was what her dress bespoke, a damsel fair,<br/>
And fresh, and &lsquo;beautiful exceedingly,&rsquo;<br/>
    Who with the brightest Georgians might compare:<br/>
They wonder&rsquo;d how Gulbeyaz, too, could be<br/>
    So silly as to buy slaves who might share<br/>
(If that his Highness wearied of his bride)<br/>
Her throne and power, and every thing beside.<br/>
<br/>
But what was strangest in this virgin crew,<br/>
    Although her beauty was enough to vex,<br/>
After the first investigating view,<br/>
    They all found out as few, or fewer, specks<br/>
In the fair form of their companion new,<br/>
    Than is the custom of the gentle sex,<br/>
When they survey, with Christian eyes or Heathen,<br/>
In a new face &lsquo;the ugliest creature breathing.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
And yet they had their little jealousies,<br/>
    Like all the rest; but upon this occasion,<br/>
Whether there are such things as sympathies<br/>
    Without our knowledge or our approbation,<br/>
Although they could not see through his disguise,<br/>
    All felt a soft kind of concatenation,<br/>
Like magnetism, or devilism, or what<br/>
You please&mdash;we will not quarrel about that:<br/>
<br/>
But certain &rsquo;tis they all felt for their new<br/>
    Companion something newer still, as &rsquo;twere<br/>
A sentimental friendship through and through,<br/>
    Extremely pure, which made them all concur<br/>
In wishing her their sister, save a few<br/>
    Who wish&rsquo;d they had a brother just like her,<br/>
Whom, if they were at home in sweet Circassia,<br/>
They would prefer to Padisha or Pacha.<br/>
<br/>
Of those who had most genius for this sort<br/>
    Of sentimental friendship, there were three,<br/>
Lolah, Katinka, and Dudu; in short<br/>
    (To save description), fair as fair can be<br/>
Were they, according to the best report,<br/>
    Though differing in stature and degree,<br/>
And clime and time, and country and complexion;<br/>
They all alike admired their new connection.<br/>
<br/>
Lolah was dusk as India and as warm;<br/>
    Katinka was a Georgian, white and red,<br/>
With great blue eyes, a lovely hand and arm,<br/>
    And feet so small they scarce seem&rsquo;d made to tread,<br/>
But rather skim the earth; while Dudu&rsquo;s form<br/>
    Look&rsquo;d more adapted to be put to bed,<br/>
Being somewhat large, and languishing, and lazy,<br/>
Yet of a beauty that would drive you crazy.<br/>
<br/>
A kind of sleepy Venus seem&rsquo;d Dudu,<br/>
    Yet very fit to &lsquo;murder sleep&rsquo; in those<br/>
Who gazed upon her cheek&rsquo;s transcendent hue,<br/>
    Her Attic forehead, and her Phidian nose:<br/>
Few angles were there in her form, &rsquo;tis true,<br/>
    Thinner she might have been, and yet scarce lose;<br/>
Yet, after all, &rsquo;twould puzzle to say where<br/>
It would not spoil some separate charm to pare.<br/>
<br/>
She was not violently lively, but<br/>
    Stole on your spirit like a May-day breaking;<br/>
Her eyes were not too sparkling, yet, half-shut,<br/>
    They put beholders in a tender taking;<br/>
She look&rsquo;d (this simile &rsquo;s quite new) just cut<br/>
    From marble, like Pygmalion&rsquo;s statue waking,<br/>
The mortal and the marble still at strife,<br/>
And timidly expanding into life.<br/>
<br/>
Lolah demanded the new damsel&rsquo;s name&mdash;<br/>
    &lsquo;Juanna.&rsquo;&mdash;Well, a pretty name enough.<br/>
Katinka ask&rsquo;d her also whence she came&mdash;<br/>
    &lsquo;From Spain.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;But where is Spain?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask such stuff,<br/>
Nor show your Georgian ignorance&mdash;for shame!&rsquo;<br/>
    Said Lolah, with an accent rather rough,<br/>
To poor Katinka: &lsquo;Spain &rsquo;s an island near<br/>
Morocco, betwixt Egypt and Tangier.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Dudu said nothing, but sat down beside<br/>
    Juanna, playing with her veil or hair;<br/>
And looking at her steadfastly, she sigh&rsquo;d,<br/>
    As if she pitied her for being there,<br/>
A pretty stranger without friend or guide,<br/>
    And all abash&rsquo;d, too, at the general stare<br/>
Which welcomes hapless strangers in all places,<br/>
With kind remarks upon their mien and faces.<br/>
<br/>
But here the Mother of the Maids drew near,<br/>
    With, &lsquo;Ladies, it is time to go to rest.<br/>
I&rsquo;m puzzled what to do with you, my dear,&rsquo;<br/>
    She added to Juanna, their new guest:<br/>
&lsquo;Your coming has been unexpected here,<br/>
    And every couch is occupied; you had best<br/>
Partake of mine; but by to-morrow early<br/>
We will have all things settled for you fairly.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Here Lolah interposed&mdash;&lsquo;Mamma, you know<br/>
    You don&rsquo;t sleep soundly, and I cannot bear<br/>
That anybody should disturb you so;<br/>
    I&rsquo;ll take Juanna; we&rsquo;re a slenderer pair<br/>
Than you would make the half of;&mdash;don&rsquo;t say no;<br/>
    And I of your young charge will take due care.&rsquo;<br/>
But here Katinka interfered, and said,<br/>
&lsquo;She also had compassion and a bed.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Besides, I hate to sleep alone,&rsquo; quoth she.<br/>
    The matron frown&rsquo;d: &lsquo;Why so?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;For fear of ghosts,&rsquo;<br/>
Replied Katinka; &lsquo;I am sure I see<br/>
    A phantom upon each of the four posts;<br/>
And then I have the worst dreams that can be,<br/>
    Of Guebres, Giaours, and Ginns, and Gouls in hosts.&rsquo;<br/>
The dame replied, &lsquo;Between your dreams and you,<br/>
I fear Juanna&rsquo;s dreams would be but few.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;You, Lolah, must continue still to lie<br/>
    Alone, for reasons which don&rsquo;t matter; you<br/>
The same, Katinka, until by and by;<br/>
    And I shall place Juanna with Dudu,<br/>
Who &rsquo;s quiet, inoffensive, silent, shy,<br/>
    And will not toss and chatter the night through.<br/>
What say you, child?&rsquo;&mdash;Dudu said nothing, as<br/>
Her talents were of the more silent class;<br/>
<br/>
But she rose up, and kiss&rsquo;d the matron&rsquo;s brow<br/>
    Between the eyes, and Lolah on both cheeks,<br/>
Katinka, too; and with a gentle bow<br/>
    (Curt&rsquo;sies are neither used by Turks nor Greeks)<br/>
She took Juanna by the hand to show<br/>
    Their place of rest, and left to both their piques,<br/>
The others pouting at the matron&rsquo;s preference<br/>
Of Dudu, though they held their tongues from deference.<br/>
<br/>
It was a spacious chamber (Oda is<br/>
    The Turkish title), and ranged round the wall<br/>
Were couches, toilets&mdash;and much more than this<br/>
    I might describe, as I have seen it all,<br/>
But it suffices&mdash;little was amiss;<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas on the whole a nobly furnish&rsquo;d hall,<br/>
With all things ladies want, save one or two,<br/>
And even those were nearer than they knew.<br/>
<br/>
Dudu, as has been said, was a sweet creature,<br/>
    Not very dashing, but extremely winning,<br/>
With the most regulated charms of feature,<br/>
    Which painters cannot catch like faces sinning<br/>
Against proportion&mdash;the wild strokes of nature<br/>
    Which they hit off at once in the beginning,<br/>
Full of expression, right or wrong, that strike,<br/>
And pleasing or unpleasing, still are like.<br/>
<br/>
But she was a soft landscape of mild earth,<br/>
    Where all was harmony, and calm, and quiet,<br/>
Luxuriant, budding; cheerful without mirth,<br/>
    Which, if not happiness, is much more nigh it<br/>
Than are your mighty passions and so forth,<br/>
    Which some call &lsquo;the sublime:&rsquo; I wish they&rsquo;d try it:<br/>
I&rsquo;ve seen your stormy seas and stormy women,<br/>
And pity lovers rather more than seamen.<br/>
<br/>
But she was pensive more than melancholy,<br/>
    And serious more than pensive, and serene,<br/>
It may be, more than either&mdash;not unholy<br/>
    Her thoughts, at least till now, appear to have been.<br/>
The strangest thing was, beauteous, she was wholly<br/>
    Unconscious, albeit turn&rsquo;d of quick seventeen,<br/>
That she was fair, or dark, or short, or tall;<br/>
She never thought about herself at all.<br/>
<br/>
And therefore was she kind and gentle as<br/>
    The Age of Gold (when gold was yet unknown,<br/>
By which its nomenclature came to pass;<br/>
    Thus most appropriately has been shown<br/>
&lsquo;Lucus a non lucendo,&rsquo; not what was,<br/>
    But what was not; a sort of style that &rsquo;s grown<br/>
Extremely common in this age, whose metal<br/>
The devil may decompose, but never settle:<br/>
<br/>
I think it may be of &lsquo;Corinthian Brass,&rsquo;<br/>
    Which was a mixture of all metals, but<br/>
The brazen uppermost). Kind reader! pass<br/>
    This long parenthesis: I could not shut<br/>
It sooner for the soul of me, and class<br/>
    My faults even with your own! which meaneth, Put<br/>
A kind construction upon them and me:<br/>
But that you won&rsquo;t&mdash;then don&rsquo;t&mdash;I am not less free.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis time we should return to plain narration,<br/>
    And thus my narrative proceeds:&mdash;Dudu,<br/>
With every kindness short of ostentation,<br/>
    Show&rsquo;d Juan, or Juanna, through and through<br/>
This labyrinth of females, and each station<br/>
    Described&mdash;what &rsquo;s strange&mdash;in words extremely few:<br/>
I have but one simile, and that &rsquo;s a blunder,<br/>
For wordless woman, which is silent thunder.<br/>
<br/>
And next she gave her (I say her, because<br/>
    The gender still was epicene, at least<br/>
In outward show, which is a saving clause)<br/>
    An outline of the customs of the East,<br/>
With all their chaste integrity of laws,<br/>
    By which the more a haram is increased,<br/>
The stricter doubtless grow the vestal duties<br/>
Of any supernumerary beauties.<br/>
<br/>
And then she gave Juanna a chaste kiss:<br/>
    Dudu was fond of kissing&mdash;which I&rsquo;m sure<br/>
That nobody can ever take amiss,<br/>
    Because &rsquo;tis pleasant, so that it be pure,<br/>
And between females means no more than this&mdash;<br/>
    That they have nothing better near, or newer.<br/>
&lsquo;Kiss&rsquo; rhymes to &lsquo;bliss&rsquo; in fact as well as verse&mdash;<br/>
I wish it never led to something worse.<br/>
<br/>
In perfect innocence she then unmade<br/>
    Her toilet, which cost little, for she was<br/>
A child of Nature, carelessly array&rsquo;d:<br/>
    If fond of a chance ogle at her glass,<br/>
&rsquo;Twas like the fawn, which, in the lake display&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Beholds her own shy, shadowy image pass,<br/>
When first she starts, and then returns to peep,<br/>
Admiring this new native of the deep.<br/>
<br/>
And one by one her articles of dress<br/>
    Were laid aside; but not before she offer&rsquo;d<br/>
Her aid to fair Juanna, whose excess<br/>
    Of modesty declined the assistance proffer&rsquo;d:<br/>
Which pass&rsquo;d well off&mdash;as she could do no less;<br/>
    Though by this politesse she rather suffer&rsquo;d,<br/>
Pricking her fingers with those cursed pins,<br/>
Which surely were invented for our sins,&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Making a woman like a porcupine,<br/>
    Not to be rashly touch&rsquo;d. But still more dread,<br/>
O ye! whose fate it is, as once &rsquo;twas mine,<br/>
    In early youth, to turn a lady&rsquo;s maid;&mdash;<br/>
I did my very boyish best to shine<br/>
    In tricking her out for a masquerade;<br/>
The pins were placed sufficiently, but not<br/>
Stuck all exactly in the proper spot.<br/>
<br/>
But these are foolish things to all the wise,<br/>
    And I love wisdom more than she loves me;<br/>
My tendency is to philosophise<br/>
    On most things, from a tyrant to a tree;<br/>
But still the spouseless virgin Knowledge flies.<br/>
    What are we? and whence came we? what shall be<br/>
Our ultimate existence? what &rsquo;s our present?<br/>
Are questions answerless, and yet incessant.<br/>
<br/>
There was deep silence in the chamber: dim<br/>
    And distant from each other burn&rsquo;d the lights,<br/>
And slumber hover&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er each lovely limb<br/>
    Of the fair occupants: if there be sprites,<br/>
They should have walk&rsquo;d there in their sprightliest trim,<br/>
    By way of change from their sepulchral sites,<br/>
And shown themselves as ghosts of better taste<br/>
Than haunting some old ruin or wild waste.<br/>
<br/>
Many and beautiful lay those around,<br/>
    Like flowers of different hue, and dime, and root,<br/>
In some exotic garden sometimes found,<br/>
    With cost, and care, and warmth induced to shoot.<br/>
One with her auburn tresses lightly bound,<br/>
    And fair brows gently drooping, as the fruit<br/>
Nods from the tree, was slumbering with soft breath,<br/>
And lips apart, which show&rsquo;d the pearls beneath.<br/>
<br/>
One with her flush&rsquo;d cheek laid on her white arm,<br/>
    And raven ringlets gather&rsquo;d in dark crowd<br/>
Above her brow, lay dreaming soft and warm;<br/>
    And smiling through her dream, as through a cloud<br/>
The moon breaks, half unveil&rsquo;d each further charm,<br/>
    As, slightly stirring in her snowy shroud,<br/>
Her beauties seized the unconscious hour of night<br/>
All bashfully to struggle into light.<br/>
<br/>
This is no bull, although it sounds so; for<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas night, but there were lamps, as hath been said.<br/>
A third&rsquo;s all pallid aspect offer&rsquo;d more<br/>
    The traits of sleeping sorrow, and betray&rsquo;d<br/>
Through the heaved breast the dream of some far shore<br/>
    Beloved and deplored; while slowly stray&rsquo;d<br/>
(As night-dew, on a cypress glittering, tinges<br/>
The black bough) tear-drops through her eyes&rsquo; dark fringes.<br/>
<br/>
A fourth as marble, statue-like and still,<br/>
    Lay in a breathless, hush&rsquo;d, and stony sleep;<br/>
White, cold, and pure, as looks a frozen rill,<br/>
    Or the snow minaret on an Alpine steep,<br/>
Or Lot&rsquo;s wife done in salt,&mdash;or what you will;&mdash;<br/>
    My similes are gather&rsquo;d in a heap,<br/>
So pick and choose&mdash;perhaps you&rsquo;ll be content<br/>
With a carved lady on a monument.<br/>
<br/>
And lo! a fifth appears;&mdash;and what is she?<br/>
    A lady of a &lsquo;certain age,&rsquo; which means<br/>
Certainly aged&mdash;what her years might be<br/>
    I know not, never counting past their teens;<br/>
But there she slept, not quite so fair to see,<br/>
    As ere that awful period intervenes<br/>
Which lays both men and women on the shelf,<br/>
To meditate upon their sins and self.<br/>
<br/>
But all this time how slept, or dream&rsquo;d, Dudu?<br/>
    With strict inquiry I could ne&rsquo;er discover,<br/>
And scorn to add a syllable untrue;<br/>
    But ere the middle watch was hardly over,<br/>
Just when the fading lamps waned dim and blue,<br/>
    And phantoms hover&rsquo;d, or might seem to hover,<br/>
To those who like their company, about<br/>
The apartment, on a sudden she scream&rsquo;d out:<br/>
<br/>
And that so loudly, that upstarted all<br/>
    The Oda, in a general commotion:<br/>
Matron and maids, and those whom you may call<br/>
    Neither, came crowding like the waves of ocean,<br/>
One on the other, throughout the whole hall,<br/>
    All trembling, wondering, without the least notion<br/>
More than I have myself of what could make<br/>
The calm Dudu so turbulently wake.<br/>
<br/>
But wide awake she was, and round her bed,<br/>
    With floating draperies and with flying hair,<br/>
With eager eyes, and light but hurried tread,<br/>
    And bosoms, arms, and ankles glancing bare,<br/>
And bright as any meteor ever bred<br/>
    By the North Pole,&mdash;they sought her cause of care,<br/>
For she seem&rsquo;d agitated, flush&rsquo;d, and frighten&rsquo;d,<br/>
Her eye dilated and her colour heighten&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
But what was strange&mdash;and a strong proof how great<br/>
    A blessing is sound sleep&mdash;Juanna lay<br/>
As fast as ever husband by his mate<br/>
    In holy matrimony snores away.<br/>
Not all the clamour broke her happy state<br/>
    Of slumber, ere they shook her,&mdash;so they say<br/>
At least,&mdash;and then she, too, unclosed her eyes,<br/>
And yawn&rsquo;d a good deal with discreet surprise.<br/>
<br/>
And now commenced a strict investigation,<br/>
    Which, as all spoke at once and more than once,<br/>
Conjecturing, wondering, asking a narration,<br/>
    Alike might puzzle either wit or dunce<br/>
To answer in a very clear oration.<br/>
    Dudu had never pass&rsquo;d for wanting sense,<br/>
But, being &lsquo;no orator as Brutus is,&rsquo;<br/>
Could not at first expound what was amiss.<br/>
<br/>
At length she said, that in a slumber sound<br/>
    She dream&rsquo;d a dream, of walking in a wood&mdash;<br/>
A &lsquo;wood obscure,&rsquo; like that where Dante found<br/>
    Himself in at the age when all grow good;<br/>
Life&rsquo;s half-way house, where dames with virtue crown&rsquo;d<br/>
    Run much less risk of lovers turning rude;<br/>
And that this wood was full of pleasant fruits,<br/>
And trees of goodly growth and spreading roots;<br/>
<br/>
And in the midst a golden apple grew,&mdash;<br/>
    A most prodigious pippin,&mdash;but it hung<br/>
Rather too high and distant; that she threw<br/>
    Her glances on it, and then, longing, flung<br/>
Stones and whatever she could pick up, to<br/>
    Bring down the fruit, which still perversely clung<br/>
To its own bough, and dangled yet in sight,<br/>
But always at a most provoking height;&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
That on a sudden, when she least had hope,<br/>
    It fell down of its own accord before<br/>
Her feet; that her first movement was to stoop<br/>
    And pick it up, and bite it to the core;<br/>
That just as her young lip began to ope<br/>
    Upon the golden fruit the vision bore,<br/>
A bee flew out and stung her to the heart,<br/>
And so&mdash;she awoke with a great scream and start.<br/>
<br/>
All this she told with some confusion and<br/>
    Dismay, the usual consequence of dreams<br/>
Of the unpleasant kind, with none at hand<br/>
    To expound their vain and visionary gleams.<br/>
I&rsquo;ve known some odd ones which seem&rsquo;d really plann&rsquo;d<br/>
    Prophetically, or that which one deems<br/>
A &lsquo;strange coincidence,&rsquo; to use a phrase<br/>
By which such things are settled now-a-days.<br/>
<br/>
The damsels, who had thoughts of some great harm,<br/>
    Began, as is the consequence of fear,<br/>
To scold a little at the false alarm<br/>
    That broke for nothing on their sleeping car.<br/>
The matron, too, was wroth to leave her warm<br/>
    Bed for the dream she had been obliged to hear,<br/>
And chafed at poor Dudu, who only sigh&rsquo;d,<br/>
And said that she was sorry she had cried.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of stories of a cock and bull;<br/>
    But visions of an apple and a bee,<br/>
To take us from our natural rest, and pull<br/>
    The whole Oda from their beds at half-past three,<br/>
Would make us think the moon is at its full.<br/>
    You surely are unwell, child! we must see,<br/>
To-morrow, what his Highness&rsquo;s physician<br/>
Will say to this hysteric of a vision.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;And poor Juanna, too&mdash;the child&rsquo;s first night<br/>
    Within these walls to be broke in upon<br/>
With such a clamour! I had thought it right<br/>
    That the young stranger should not lie alone,<br/>
And, as the quietest of all, she might<br/>
    With you, Dudu, a good night&rsquo;s rest have known;<br/>
But now I must transfer her to the charge<br/>
Of Lolah&mdash;though her couch is not so large.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Lolah&rsquo;s eyes sparkled at the proposition;<br/>
    But poor Dudu, with large drops in her own,<br/>
Resulting from the scolding or the vision,<br/>
    Implored that present pardon might be shown<br/>
For this first fault, and that on no condition<br/>
    (She added in a soft and piteous tone)<br/>
Juanna should be taken from her, and<br/>
Her future dreams should all be kept in hand.<br/>
<br/>
She promised never more to have a dream,<br/>
    At least to dream so loudly as just now;<br/>
She wonder&rsquo;d at herself how she could scream&mdash;<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas foolish, nervous, as she must allow,<br/>
A fond hallucination, and a theme<br/>
    For laughter&mdash;but she felt her spirits low,<br/>
And begg&rsquo;d they would excuse her; she&rsquo;d get over<br/>
This weakness in a few hours, and recover.<br/>
<br/>
And here Juanna kindly interposed,<br/>
    And said she felt herself extremely well<br/>
Where she then was, as her sound sleep disclosed<br/>
    When all around rang like a tocsin bell:<br/>
She did not find herself the least disposed<br/>
    To quit her gentle partner, and to dwell<br/>
Apart from one who had no sin to show,<br/>
Save that of dreaming once &lsquo;mal-a-propos.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
As thus Juanna spoke, Dudu turn&rsquo;d round<br/>
    And hid her face within Juanna&rsquo;s breast:<br/>
Her neck alone was seen, but that was found<br/>
    The colour of a budding rose&rsquo;s crest.<br/>
I can&rsquo;t tell why she blush&rsquo;d, nor can expound<br/>
    The mystery of this rupture of their rest;<br/>
All that I know is, that the facts I state<br/>
Are true as truth has ever been of late.<br/>
<br/>
And so good night to them,&mdash;or, if you will,<br/>
    Good morrow&mdash;for the cock had crown, and light<br/>
Began to clothe each Asiatic hill,<br/>
    And the mosque crescent struggled into sight<br/>
Of the long caravan, which in the chill<br/>
    Of dewy dawn wound slowly round each height<br/>
That stretches to the stony belt, which girds<br/>
Asia, where Kaff looks down upon the Kurds.<br/>
<br/>
With the first ray, or rather grey of morn,<br/>
    Gulbeyaz rose from restlessness; and pale<br/>
As passion rises, with its bosom worn,<br/>
    Array&rsquo;d herself with mantle, gem, and veil.<br/>
The nightingale that sings with the deep thorn,<br/>
    Which fable places in her breast of wail,<br/>
Is lighter far of heart and voice than those<br/>
Whose headlong passions form their proper woes.<br/>
<br/>
And that &rsquo;s the moral of this composition,<br/>
    If people would but see its real drift;&mdash;<br/>
But that they will not do without suspicion,<br/>
    Because all gentle readers have the gift<br/>
Of closing &rsquo;gainst the light their orbs of vision;<br/>
    While gentle writers also love to lift<br/>
Their voices &rsquo;gainst each other, which is natural,<br/>
The numbers are too great for them to flatter all.<br/>
<br/>
Rose the sultana from a bed of splendour,<br/>
    Softer than the soft Sybarite&rsquo;s, who cried<br/>
Aloud because his feelings were too tender<br/>
    To brook a ruffled rose-leaf by his side,&mdash;<br/>
So beautiful that art could little mend her,<br/>
    Though pale with conflicts between love and pride;&mdash;<br/>
So agitated was she with her error,<br/>
She did not even look into the mirror.<br/>
<br/>
Also arose about the self-same time,<br/>
    Perhaps a little later, her great lord,<br/>
Master of thirty kingdoms so sublime,<br/>
    And of a wife by whom he was abhorr&rsquo;d;<br/>
A thing of much less import in that clime&mdash;<br/>
    At least to those of incomes which afford<br/>
The filling up their whole connubial cargo&mdash;<br/>
Than where two wives are under an embargo.<br/>
<br/>
He did not think much on the matter, nor<br/>
    Indeed on any other: as a man<br/>
He liked to have a handsome paramour<br/>
    At hand, as one may like to have a fan,<br/>
And therefore of Circassians had good store,<br/>
    As an amusement after the Divan;<br/>
Though an unusual fit of love, or duty,<br/>
Had made him lately bask in his bride&rsquo;s beauty.<br/>
<br/>
And now he rose; and after due ablutions<br/>
    Exacted by the customs of the East,<br/>
And prayers and other pious evolutions,<br/>
    He drank six cups of coffee at the least,<br/>
And then withdrew to hear about the Russians,<br/>
    Whose victories had recently increased<br/>
In Catherine&rsquo;s reign, whom glory still adores,<br/>
<br/>
But oh, thou grand legitimate Alexander!<br/>
    Her son&rsquo;s son, let not this last phrase offend<br/>
Thine ear, if it should reach&mdash;and now rhymes wander<br/>
    Almost as far as Petersburgh and lend<br/>
A dreadful impulse to each loud meander<br/>
    Of murmuring Liberty&rsquo;s wide waves, which blend<br/>
Their roar even with the Baltic&rsquo;s&mdash;so you be<br/>
Your father&rsquo;s son, &rsquo;tis quite enough for me.<br/>
<br/>
To call men love-begotten or proclaim<br/>
    Their mothers as the antipodes of Timon,<br/>
That hater of mankind, would be a shame,<br/>
    A libel, or whate&rsquo;er you please to rhyme on:<br/>
But people&rsquo;s ancestors are history&rsquo;s game;<br/>
    And if one lady&rsquo;s slip could leave a crime on<br/>
All generations, I should like to know<br/>
What pedigree the best would have to show?<br/>
<br/>
Had Catherine and the sultan understood<br/>
    Their own true interests, which kings rarely know<br/>
Until &rsquo;tis taught by lessons rather rude,<br/>
    There was a way to end their strife, although<br/>
Perhaps precarious, had they but thought good,<br/>
    Without the aid of prince or plenipo:<br/>
She to dismiss her guards and he his haram,<br/>
And for their other matters, meet and share &rsquo;em.<br/>
<br/>
But as it was, his Highness had to hold<br/>
    His daily council upon ways and means<br/>
How to encounter with this martial scold,<br/>
    This modern Amazon and queen of queans;<br/>
And the perplexity could not be told<br/>
    Of all the pillars of the state, which leans<br/>
Sometimes a little heavy on the backs<br/>
Of those who cannot lay on a new tax.<br/>
<br/>
Meantime Gulbeyaz, when her king was gone,<br/>
    Retired into her boudoir, a sweet place<br/>
For love or breakfast; private, pleasing, lone,<br/>
    And rich with all contrivances which grace<br/>
Those gay recesses:&mdash;many a precious stone<br/>
    Sparkled along its roof, and many a vase<br/>
Of porcelain held in the fetter&rsquo;d flowers,<br/>
Those captive soothers of a captive&rsquo;s hours.<br/>
<br/>
Mother of pearl, and porphyry, and marble,<br/>
    Vied with each other on this costly spot;<br/>
And singing birds without were heard to warble;<br/>
    And the stain&rsquo;d glass which lighted this fair grot<br/>
Varied each ray;&mdash;but all descriptions garble<br/>
    The true effect, and so we had better not<br/>
Be too minute; an outline is the best,&mdash;<br/>
A lively reader&rsquo;s fancy does the rest.<br/>
<br/>
And here she summon&rsquo;d Baba, and required<br/>
    Don Juan at his hands, and information<br/>
Of what had pass&rsquo;d since all the slaves retired,<br/>
    And whether he had occupied their station;<br/>
If matters had been managed as desired,<br/>
    And his disguise with due consideration<br/>
Kept up; and above all, the where and how<br/>
He had pass&rsquo;d the night, was what she wish&rsquo;d to know.<br/>
<br/>
Baba, with some embarrassment, replied<br/>
    To this long catechism of questions, ask&rsquo;d<br/>
More easily than answer&rsquo;d,&mdash;that he had tried<br/>
    His best to obey in what he had been task&rsquo;d;<br/>
But there seem&rsquo;d something that he wish&rsquo;d to hide,<br/>
    Which hesitation more betray&rsquo;d than mask&rsquo;d;<br/>
He scratch&rsquo;d his ear, the infallible resource<br/>
To which embarrass&rsquo;d people have recourse.<br/>
<br/>
Gulbeyaz was no model of true patience,<br/>
    Nor much disposed to wait in word or deed;<br/>
She liked quick answers in all conversations;<br/>
    And when she saw him stumbling like a steed<br/>
In his replies, she puzzled him for fresh ones;<br/>
    And as his speech grew still more broken-kneed,<br/>
Her cheek began to flush, her eyes to sparkle,<br/>
And her proud brow&rsquo;s blue veins to swell and darkle.<br/>
<br/>
When Baba saw these symptoms, which he knew<br/>
    To bode him no great good, he deprecated<br/>
Her anger, and beseech&rsquo;d she&rsquo;d hear him through&mdash;<br/>
    He could not help the thing which he related:<br/>
Then out it came at length, that to Dudu<br/>
    Juan was given in charge, as hath been stated;<br/>
But not by Baba&rsquo;s fault, he said, and swore on<br/>
The holy camel&rsquo;s hump, besides the Koran.<br/>
<br/>
The chief dame of the Oda, upon whom<br/>
    The discipline of the whole haram bore,<br/>
As soon as they re-enter&rsquo;d their own room,<br/>
    For Baba&rsquo;s function stopt short at the door,<br/>
Had settled all; nor could he then presume<br/>
    (The aforesaid Baba) just then to do more,<br/>
Without exciting such suspicion as<br/>
Might make the matter still worse than it was.<br/>
<br/>
He hoped, indeed he thought, he could be sure<br/>
    Juan had not betray&rsquo;d himself; in fact<br/>
&rsquo;Twas certain that his conduct had been pure,<br/>
    Because a foolish or imprudent act<br/>
Would not alone have made him insecure,<br/>
    But ended in his being found out and sack&rsquo;d,<br/>
And thrown into the sea.&mdash;Thus Baba spoke<br/>
Of all save Dudu&rsquo;s dream, which was no joke.<br/>
<br/>
This he discreetly kept in the background,<br/>
    And talk&rsquo;d away&mdash;and might have talk&rsquo;d till now,<br/>
For any further answer that he found,<br/>
    So deep an anguish wrung Gulbeyaz&rsquo; brow:<br/>
Her cheek turn&rsquo;d ashes, ears rung, brain whirl&rsquo;d round,<br/>
    As if she had received a sudden blow,<br/>
And the heart&rsquo;s dew of pain sprang fast and chilly<br/>
O&rsquo;er her fair front, like Morning&rsquo;s on a lily.<br/>
<br/>
Although she was not of the fainting sort,<br/>
    Baba thought she would faint, but there he err&rsquo;d&mdash;<br/>
It was but a convulsion, which though short<br/>
    Can never be described; we all have heard,<br/>
And some of us have felt thus &lsquo;all amort,&rsquo;<br/>
    When things beyond the common have occurr&rsquo;d;&mdash;<br/>
Gulbeyaz proved in that brief agony<br/>
What she could ne&rsquo;er express&mdash;then how should I?<br/>
<br/>
She stood a moment as a Pythones<br/>
    Stands on her tripod, agonised, and full<br/>
Of inspiration gather&rsquo;d from distress,<br/>
    When all the heart-strings like wild horses pull<br/>
The heart asunder;&mdash;then, as more or lees<br/>
    Their speed abated or their strength grew dull,<br/>
She sunk down on her seat by slow degrees,<br/>
And bow&rsquo;d her throbbing head o&rsquo;er trembling knees.<br/>
<br/>
Her face declined and was unseen; her hair<br/>
    Fell in long tresses like the weeping willow,<br/>
Sweeping the marble underneath her chair,<br/>
    Or rather sofa (for it was all pillow,<br/>
A low soft ottoman), and black despair<br/>
    Stirr&rsquo;d up and down her bosom like a billow,<br/>
Which rushes to some shore whose shingles check<br/>
Its farther course, but must receive its wreck.<br/>
<br/>
Her head hung down, and her long hair in stooping<br/>
    Conceal&rsquo;d her features better than a veil;<br/>
And one hand o&rsquo;er the ottoman lay drooping,<br/>
    White, waxen, and as alabaster pale:<br/>
Would that I were a painter! to be grouping<br/>
    All that a poet drags into detail<br/>
O that my words were colours! but their tints<br/>
May serve perhaps as outlines or slight hints.<br/>
<br/>
Baba, who knew by experience when to talk<br/>
    And when to hold his tongue, now held it till<br/>
This passion might blow o&rsquo;er, nor dared to balk<br/>
    Gulbeyaz&rsquo; taciturn or speaking will.<br/>
At length she rose up, and began to walk<br/>
    Slowly along the room, but silent still,<br/>
And her brow clear&rsquo;d, but not her troubled eye;<br/>
The wind was down, but still the sea ran high.<br/>
<br/>
She stopp&rsquo;d, and raised her head to speak&mdash;but paused,<br/>
    And then moved on again with rapid pace;<br/>
Then slacken&rsquo;d it, which is the march most caused<br/>
    By deep emotion:&mdash;you may sometimes trace<br/>
A feeling in each footstep, as disclosed<br/>
    By Sallust in his Catiline, who, chased<br/>
By all the demons of all passions, show&rsquo;d<br/>
Their work even by the way in which he trode.<br/>
<br/>
Gulbeyaz stopp&rsquo;d and beckon&rsquo;d Baba:&mdash;&lsquo;Slave!<br/>
    Bring the two slaves!&rsquo; she said in a low tone,<br/>
But one which Baba did not like to brave,<br/>
    And yet he shudder&rsquo;d, and seem&rsquo;d rather prone<br/>
To prove reluctant, and begg&rsquo;d leave to crave<br/>
    (Though he well knew the meaning) to be shown<br/>
What slaves her highness wish&rsquo;d to indicate,<br/>
For fear of any error, like the late.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;The Georgian and her paramour,&rsquo; replied<br/>
    The imperial bride&mdash;and added, &lsquo;Let the boat<br/>
Be ready by the secret portal&rsquo;s side:<br/>
    You know the rest.&rsquo; The words stuck in her throat,<br/>
Despite her injured love and fiery pride;<br/>
    And of this Baba willingly took note,<br/>
And begg&rsquo;d by every hair of Mahomet&rsquo;s beard,<br/>
She would revoke the order he had heard.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;To hear is to obey,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but still,<br/>
    Sultana, think upon the consequence:<br/>
It is not that I shall not all fulfil<br/>
    Your orders, even in their severest sense;<br/>
But such precipitation may end ill,<br/>
    Even at your own imperative expense:<br/>
I do not mean destruction and exposure,<br/>
In case of any premature disclosure;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;But your own feelings. Even should all the rest<br/>
    Be hidden by the rolling waves, which hide<br/>
Already many a once love-beaten breast<br/>
    Deep in the caverns of the deadly tide&mdash;<br/>
You love this boyish, new, seraglio guest,<br/>
    And if this violent remedy be tried&mdash;<br/>
Excuse my freedom, when I here assure you,<br/>
That killing him is not the way to cure you.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;What dost thou know of love or feeling?&mdash;Wretch!<br/>
    Begone!&rsquo; she cried, with kindling eyes&mdash;&lsquo;and do<br/>
My bidding!&rsquo; Baba vanish&rsquo;d, for to stretch<br/>
    His own remonstrance further he well knew<br/>
Might end in acting as his own &lsquo;Jack Ketch;&rsquo;<br/>
    And though he wish&rsquo;d extremely to get through<br/>
This awkward business without harm to others,<br/>
He still preferr&rsquo;d his own neck to another&rsquo;s.<br/>
<br/>
Away he went then upon his commission,<br/>
    Growling and grumbling in good Turkish phrase<br/>
Against all women of whate&rsquo;er condition,<br/>
    Especially sultanas and their ways;<br/>
Their obstinacy, pride, and indecision,<br/>
    Their never knowing their own mind two days,<br/>
The trouble that they gave, their immorality,<br/>
Which made him daily bless his own neutrality.<br/>
<br/>
And then he call&rsquo;d his brethren to his aid,<br/>
    And sent one on a summons to the pair,<br/>
That they must instantly be well array&rsquo;d,<br/>
    And above all be comb&rsquo;d even to a hair,<br/>
And brought before the empress, who had made<br/>
    Inquiries after them with kindest care:<br/>
At which Dudu look&rsquo;d strange, and Juan silly;<br/>
But go they must at once, and will I&mdash;nill I.<br/>
<br/>
And here I leave them at their preparation<br/>
    For the imperial presence, wherein whether<br/>
Gulbeyaz show&rsquo;d them both commiseration,<br/>
    Or got rid of the parties altogether,<br/>
Like other angry ladies of her nation,&mdash;<br/>
    Are things the turning of a hair or feather<br/>
May settle; but far be &rsquo;t from me to anticipate<br/>
In what way feminine caprice may dissipate.<br/>
<br/>
I leave them for the present with good wishes,<br/>
    Though doubts of their well doing, to arrange<br/>
Another part of history; for the dishes<br/>
    Of this our banquet we must sometimes change;<br/>
And trusting Juan may escape the fishes,<br/>
    Although his situation now seems strange<br/>
And scarce secure, as such digressions are fair,<br/>
The Muse will take a little touch at warfare.<br/>

<h2><a name="2H_4_0008"></a>
CANTO THE SEVENTH.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
O Love! O Glory! what are ye who fly<br/>
    Around us ever, rarely to alight?<br/>
There&rsquo;s not a meteor in the polar sky<br/>
    Of such transcendent and more fleeting flight.<br/>
Chill, and chain&rsquo;d to cold earth, we lift on high<br/>
    Our eyes in search of either lovely light;<br/>
A thousand and a thousand colours they<br/>
Assume, then leave us on our freezing way.<br/>
<br/>
And such as they are, such my present tale is,<br/>
    A non-descript and ever-varying rhyme,<br/>
A versified Aurora Borealis,<br/>
    Which flashes o&rsquo;er a waste and icy clime.<br/>
When we know what all are, we must bewail us,<br/>
    But ne&rsquo;ertheless I hope it is no crime<br/>
To laugh at all things&mdash;for I wish to know<br/>
What, after all, are all things&mdash;but a show?<br/>
<br/>
They accuse me&mdash;Me&mdash;the present writer of<br/>
    The present poem&mdash;of&mdash;I know not what&mdash;<br/>
A tendency to under-rate and scoff<br/>
    At human power and virtue, and all that;<br/>
And this they say in language rather rough.<br/>
    Good God! I wonder what they would be at!<br/>
I say no more than hath been said in Dante&rsquo;s<br/>
Verse, and by Solomon and by Cervantes;<br/>
<br/>
By Swift, by Machiavel, by Rochefoucault,<br/>
    By Fenelon, by Luther, and by Plato;<br/>
By Tillotson, and Wesley, and Rousseau,<br/>
    Who knew this life was not worth a potato.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis not their fault, nor mine, if this be so&mdash;<br/>
    For my part, I pretend not to be Cato,<br/>
Nor even Diogenes.&mdash;We live and die,<br/>
But which is best, you know no more than I.<br/>
<br/>
Socrates said, our only knowledge was<br/>
    &lsquo;To know that nothing could be known;&rsquo; a pleasant<br/>
Science enough, which levels to an ass<br/>
    Each man of wisdom, future, past, or present.<br/>
Newton (that proverb of the mind), alas!<br/>
    Declared, with all his grand discoveries recent,<br/>
That he himself felt only&rsquo;like a youth<br/>
Picking up shells by the great ocean&mdash;Truth.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Ecclesiastes said, &lsquo;that all is vanity&rsquo;-<br/>
    Most modern preachers say the same, or show it<br/>
By their examples of true Christianity:<br/>
    In short, all know, or very soon may know it;<br/>
And in this scene of all-confess&rsquo;d inanity,<br/>
    By saint, by sage, by preacher, and by poet,<br/>
Must I restrain me, through the fear of strife,<br/>
From holding up the nothingness of life?<br/>
<br/>
Dogs, or men!&mdash;for I flatter you in saying<br/>
    That ye are dogs&mdash;your betters far&mdash;ye may<br/>
Read, or read not, what I am now essaying<br/>
    To show ye what ye are in every way.<br/>
As little as the moon stops for the baying<br/>
    Of wolves, will the bright muse withdraw one ray<br/>
From out her skies&mdash;then howl your idle wrath!<br/>
While she still silvers o&rsquo;er your gloomy path.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Fierce loves and faithless wars&rsquo;&mdash;I am not sure<br/>
    If this be the right reading&mdash;&rsquo;tis no matter;<br/>
The fact &rsquo;s about the same, I am secure;<br/>
    I sing them both, and am about to batter<br/>
A town which did a famous siege endure,<br/>
    And was beleaguer&rsquo;d both by land and water<br/>
By Souvaroff, or Anglice Suwarrow,<br/>
Who loved blood as an alderman loves marrow.<br/>
<br/>
The fortress is call&rsquo;d Ismail, and is placed<br/>
    Upon the Danube&rsquo;s left branch and left bank,<br/>
With buildings in the Oriental taste,<br/>
    But still a fortress of the foremost rank,<br/>
Or was at least, unless &rsquo;tis since defaced,<br/>
    Which with your conquerors is a common prank:<br/>
It stands some eighty versts from the high sea,<br/>
And measures round of toises thousands three.<br/>
<br/>
Within the extent of this fortification<br/>
    A borough is comprised along the height<br/>
Upon the left, which from its loftier station<br/>
    Commands the city, and upon its site<br/>
A Greek had raised around this elevation<br/>
    A quantity of palisades upright,<br/>
So placed as to impede the fire of those<br/>
Who held the place, and to assist the foe&rsquo;s.<br/>
<br/>
This circumstance may serve to give a notion<br/>
    Of the high talents of this new Vauban:<br/>
But the town ditch below was deep as ocean,<br/>
    The rampart higher than you&rsquo;d wish to hang:<br/>
But then there was a great want of precaution<br/>
    (Prithee, excuse this engineering slang),<br/>
Nor work advanced, nor cover&rsquo;d way was there,<br/>
To hint at least &lsquo;Here is no thoroughfare.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
But a stone bastion, with a narrow gorge,<br/>
    And walls as thick as most skulls born as yet;<br/>
Two batteries, cap-a-pie, as our St. George,<br/>
    Case-mated one, and t&rsquo; other &lsquo;a barbette,&rsquo;<br/>
Of Danube&rsquo;s bank took formidable charge;<br/>
    While two and twenty cannon duly set<br/>
Rose over the town&rsquo;s right side, in bristling tier,<br/>
Forty feet high, upon a cavalier.<br/>
<br/>
But from the river the town &rsquo;s open quite,<br/>
    Because the Turks could never be persuaded<br/>
A Russian vessel e&rsquo;er would heave in sight;<br/>
    And such their creed was, till they were invaded,<br/>
When it grew rather late to set things right.<br/>
    But as the Danube could not well be waded,<br/>
They look&rsquo;d upon the Muscovite flotilla,<br/>
And only shouted, &lsquo;Allah!&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bis Millah!&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
The Russians now were ready to attack:<br/>
    But oh, ye goddesses of war and glory!<br/>
How shall I spell the name of each Cossacque<br/>
    Who were immortal, could one tell their story?<br/>
Alas! what to their memory can lack?<br/>
    Achilles&rsquo; self was not more grim and gory<br/>
Than thousands of this new and polish&rsquo;d nation,<br/>
Whose names want nothing but&mdash;pronunciation.<br/>
<br/>
Still I&rsquo;ll record a few, if but to increase<br/>
    Our euphony: there was Strongenoff, and Strokonoff,<br/>
Meknop, Serge Lwow, Arsniew of modern Greece,<br/>
    And Tschitsshakoff, and Roguenoff, and Chokenoff,<br/>
And others of twelve consonants apiece;<br/>
    And more might be found out, if I could poke enough<br/>
Into gazettes; but Fame (capricious strumpet),<br/>
It seems, has got an ear as well as trumpet,<br/>
<br/>
And cannot tune those discords of narration,<br/>
    Which may be names at Moscow, into rhyme;<br/>
Yet there were several worth commemoration,<br/>
    As e&rsquo;er was virgin of a nuptial chime;<br/>
Soft words, too, fitted for the peroration<br/>
    Of Londonderry drawling against time,<br/>
Ending in &lsquo;ischskin,&rsquo; &lsquo;ousckin,&rsquo; &lsquo;iffskchy,&rsquo; &lsquo;ouski:<br/>
Of whom we can insert but Rousamouski,<br/>
<br/>
Scherematoff and Chrematoff, Koklophti,<br/>
    Koclobski, Kourakin, and Mouskin Pouskin,<br/>
All proper men of weapons, as e&rsquo;er scoff&rsquo;d high<br/>
    Against a foe, or ran a sabre through skin:<br/>
Little cared they for Mahomet or Mufti,<br/>
    Unless to make their kettle-drums a new skin<br/>
Out of their hides, if parchment had grown dear,<br/>
And no more handy substitute been near.<br/>
<br/>
Then there were foreigners of much renown,<br/>
    Of various nations, and all volunteers;<br/>
Not fighting for their country or its crown,<br/>
    But wishing to be one day brigadiers;<br/>
Also to have the sacking of a town,&mdash;<br/>
    A pleasant thing to young men at their years.<br/>
&rsquo;Mongst them were several Englishmen of pith,<br/>
Sixteen call&rsquo;d Thomson, and nineteen named Smith.<br/>
<br/>
Jack Thomson and Bill Thomson; all the rest<br/>
    Had been call&rsquo;d &lsquo;Jemmy,&rsquo; after the great bard;<br/>
I don&rsquo;t know whether they had arms or crest,<br/>
    But such a godfather &rsquo;s as good a card.<br/>
Three of the Smiths were Peters; but the best<br/>
    Amongst them all, hard blows to inflict or ward,<br/>
Was he, since so renown&rsquo;d &lsquo;in country quarters<br/>
At Halifax;&rsquo; but now he served the Tartars.<br/>
<br/>
The rest were jacks and Gills and Wills and Bills;<br/>
    But when I&rsquo;ve added that the elder jack Smith<br/>
Was born in Cumberland among the hills,<br/>
    And that his father was an honest blacksmith,<br/>
I&rsquo;ve said all I know of a name that fills<br/>
    Three lines of the despatch in taking &lsquo;Schmacksmith,&rsquo;<br/>
A village of Moldavia&rsquo;s waste, wherein<br/>
He fell, immortal in a bulletin.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder (although Mars no doubt &rsquo;s a god<br/>
    Praise) if a man&rsquo;s name in a bulletin<br/>
May make up for a bullet in his body?<br/>
    I hope this little question is no sin,<br/>
Because, though I am but a simple noddy,<br/>
    I think one Shakspeare puts the same thought in<br/>
The mouth of some one in his plays so doting,<br/>
Which many people pass for wits by quoting.<br/>
<br/>
Then there were Frenchmen, gallant, young, and gay:<br/>
    But I&rsquo;m too great a patriot to record<br/>
Their Gallic names upon a glorious day;<br/>
    I&rsquo;d rather tell ten lies than say a word<br/>
Of truth;&mdash;such truths are treason; they betray<br/>
    Their country; and as traitors are abhorr&rsquo;d<br/>
Who name the French in English, save to show<br/>
How Peace should make John Bull the Frenchman&rsquo;s foe.<br/>
<br/>
The Russians, having built two batteries on<br/>
    An isle near Ismail, had two ends in view;<br/>
The first was to bombard it, and knock down<br/>
    The public buildings and the private too,<br/>
No matter what poor souls might be undone.<br/>
    The city&rsquo;s shape suggested this, &rsquo;tis true;<br/>
Form&rsquo;d like an amphitheatre, each dwelling<br/>
Presented a fine mark to throw a shell in.<br/>
<br/>
The second object was to profit by<br/>
    The moment of the general consternation,<br/>
To attack the Turk&rsquo;s flotilla, which lay nigh<br/>
    Extremely tranquil, anchor&rsquo;d at its station:<br/>
But a third motive was as probably<br/>
    To frighten them into capitulation;<br/>
A phantasy which sometimes seizes warriors,<br/>
Unless they are game as bull-dogs and fox-terriers.<br/>
<br/>
A habit rather blamable, which is<br/>
    That of despising those we combat with,<br/>
Common in many cases, was in this<br/>
    The cause of killing Tchitchitzkoff and Smith;<br/>
One of the valorous &lsquo;Smiths&rsquo; whom we shall miss<br/>
    Out of those nineteen who late rhymed to &lsquo;pith;&rsquo;<br/>
But &rsquo;tis a name so spread o&rsquo;er &lsquo;Sir&rsquo; and &lsquo;Madam,&rsquo;<br/>
That one would think the first who bore it &lsquo;Adam.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
The Russian batteries were incomplete,<br/>
    Because they were constructed in a hurry;<br/>
Thus the same cause which makes a verse want feet,<br/>
    And throws a cloud o&rsquo;er Longman and John Murray,<br/>
When the sale of new books is not so fleet<br/>
    As they who print them think is necessary,<br/>
May likewise put off for a time what story<br/>
Sometimes calls &lsquo;murder,&rsquo; and at others &lsquo;glory.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Whether it was their engineer&rsquo;s stupidity,<br/>
    Their haste, or waste, I neither know nor care,<br/>
Or some contractor&rsquo;s personal cupidity,<br/>
    Saving his soul by cheating in the ware<br/>
Of homicide, but there was no solidity<br/>
    In the new batteries erected there;<br/>
They either miss&rsquo;d, or they were never miss&rsquo;d,<br/>
And added greatly to the missing list.<br/>
<br/>
A sad miscalculation about distance<br/>
    Made all their naval matters incorrect;<br/>
Three fireships lost their amiable existence<br/>
    Before they reach&rsquo;d a spot to take effect:<br/>
The match was lit too soon, and no assistance<br/>
    Could remedy this lubberly defect;<br/>
They blew up in the middle of the river,<br/>
While, though &rsquo;twas dawn, the Turks slept fast as ever.<br/>
<br/>
At seven they rose, however, and survey&rsquo;d<br/>
    The Russ flotilla getting under way;<br/>
&rsquo;Twas nine, when still advancing undismay&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Within a cable&rsquo;s length their vessels lay<br/>
Off Ismail, and commenced a cannonade,<br/>
    Which was return&rsquo;d with interest, I may say,<br/>
And by a fire of musketry and grape,<br/>
And shells and shot of every size and shape.<br/>
<br/>
For six hours bore they without intermission<br/>
    The Turkish fire, and aided by their own<br/>
Land batteries, work&rsquo;d their guns with great precision:<br/>
    At length they found mere cannonade alone<br/>
By no means would produce the town&rsquo;s submission,<br/>
    And made a signal to retreat at one.<br/>
One bark blew up, a second near the works<br/>
Running aground, was taken by the Turks.<br/>
<br/>
The Moslem, too, had lost both ships and men;<br/>
    But when they saw the enemy retire,<br/>
Their Delhis mann&rsquo;d some boats, and sail&rsquo;d again,<br/>
    And gall&rsquo;d the Russians with a heavy fire,<br/>
And tried to make a landing on the main;<br/>
    But here the effect fell short of their desire:<br/>
Count Damas drove them back into the water<br/>
Pell-mell, and with a whole gazette of slaughter.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;If&rsquo; (says the historian here) &lsquo;I could report<br/>
    All that the Russians did upon this day,<br/>
I think that several volumes would fall short,<br/>
    And I should still have many things to say;&rsquo;<br/>
And so he says no more&mdash;but pays his court<br/>
    To some distinguish&rsquo;d strangers in that fray;<br/>
The Prince de Ligne, and Langeron, and Damas,<br/>
Names great as any that the roll of Fame has.<br/>
<br/>
This being the case, may show us what Fame is:<br/>
    For out of these three &lsquo;preux Chevaliers,&rsquo; how<br/>
Many of common readers give a guess<br/>
    That such existed? (and they may live now<br/>
For aught we know.) Renown &rsquo;s all hit or miss;<br/>
    There&rsquo;s fortune even in fame, we must allow.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis true the Memoirs of the Prince de Ligne<br/>
Have half withdrawn from him oblivion&rsquo;s screen.<br/>
<br/>
But here are men who fought in gallant actions<br/>
    As gallantly as ever heroes fought,<br/>
But buried in the heap of such transactions<br/>
    Their names are rarely found, nor often sought.<br/>
Thus even good fame may suffer sad contractions,<br/>
    And is extinguish&rsquo;d sooner than she ought:<br/>
Of all our modern battles, I will bet<br/>
You can&rsquo;t repeat nine names from each Gazette.<br/>
<br/>
In short, this last attack, though rich in glory,<br/>
    Show&rsquo;d that somewhere, somehow, there was a fault,<br/>
And Admiral Ribas (known in Russian story)<br/>
    Most strongly recommended an assault;<br/>
In which he was opposed by young and hoary,<br/>
    Which made a long debate; but I must halt,<br/>
For if I wrote down every warrior&rsquo;s speech,<br/>
I doubt few readers e&rsquo;er would mount the breach.<br/>
<br/>
There was a man, if that he was a man,<br/>
    Not that his manhood could be call&rsquo;d in question,<br/>
For had he not been Hercules, his span<br/>
    Had been as short in youth as indigestion<br/>
Made his last illness, when, all worn and wan,<br/>
    He died beneath a tree, as much unblest on<br/>
The soil of the green province he had wasted,<br/>
As e&rsquo;er was locust on the land it blasted.<br/>
<br/>
This was Potemkin&mdash;a great thing in days<br/>
    When homicide and harlotry made great;<br/>
If stars and titles could entail long praise,<br/>
    His glory might half equal his estate.<br/>
This fellow, being six foot high, could raise<br/>
    A kind of phantasy proportionate<br/>
In the then sovereign of the Russian people,<br/>
Who measured men as you would do a steeple.<br/>
<br/>
While things were in abeyance, Ribas sent<br/>
    A courier to the prince, and he succeeded<br/>
In ordering matters after his own bent;<br/>
    I cannot tell the way in which he pleaded,<br/>
But shortly he had cause to be content.<br/>
    In the mean time, the batteries proceeded,<br/>
And fourscore cannon on the Danube&rsquo;s border<br/>
Were briskly fired and answer&rsquo;d in due order.<br/>
<br/>
But on the thirteenth, when already part<br/>
    Of the troops were embark&rsquo;d, the siege to raise,<br/>
A courier on the spur inspired new heart<br/>
    Into all panters for newspaper praise,<br/>
As well as dilettanti in war&rsquo;s art,<br/>
    By his despatches couch&rsquo;d in pithy phrase;<br/>
Announcing the appointment of that lover of<br/>
Battles to the command, Field-Marshal Souvaroff.<br/>
<br/>
The letter of the prince to the same marshal<br/>
    Was worthy of a Spartan, had the cause<br/>
Been one to which a good heart could be partial&mdash;<br/>
    Defence of freedom, country, or of laws;<br/>
But as it was mere lust of power to o&rsquo;er-arch all<br/>
    With its proud brow, it merits slight applause,<br/>
Save for its style, which said, all in a trice,<br/>
&lsquo;You will take Ismail at whatever price.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Let there be light! said God, and there was light!&rsquo;<br/>
    &lsquo;Let there be blood!&rsquo; says man, and there&rsquo;s a seal<br/>
The fiat of this spoil&rsquo;d child of the Night<br/>
    (For Day ne&rsquo;er saw his merits) could decree<br/>
More evil in an hour, than thirty bright<br/>
    Summers could renovate, though they should be<br/>
Lovely as those which ripen&rsquo;d Eden&rsquo;s fruit;<br/>
For war cuts up not only branch, but root.<br/>
<br/>
Our friends the Turks, who with loud &lsquo;Allahs&rsquo; now<br/>
    Began to signalise the Russ retreat,<br/>
Were damnably mistaken; few are slow<br/>
    In thinking that their enemy is beat<br/>
(Or beaten, if you insist on grammar, though<br/>
    I never think about it in a heat),<br/>
But here I say the Turks were much mistaken,<br/>
Who hating hogs, yet wish&rsquo;d to save their bacon.<br/>
<br/>
For, on the sixteenth, at full gallop, drew<br/>
    In sight two horsemen, who were deem&rsquo;d Cossacques<br/>
For some time, till they came in nearer view.<br/>
    They had but little baggage at their backs,<br/>
For there were but three shirts between the two;<br/>
    But on they rode upon two Ukraine hacks,<br/>
Till, in approaching, were at length descried<br/>
In this plain pair, Suwarrow and his guide.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Great joy to London now!&rsquo; says some great fool,<br/>
    When London had a grand illumination,<br/>
Which to that bottle-conjurer, John Bull,<br/>
    Is of all dreams the first hallucination;<br/>
So that the streets of colour&rsquo;d lamps are full,<br/>
    That Sage (said john) surrenders at discretion<br/>
His purse, his soul, his sense, and even his nonsense,<br/>
To gratify, like a huge moth, this one sense.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis strange that he should farther &lsquo;damn his eyes,&rsquo;<br/>
    For they are damn&rsquo;d; that once all-famous oath<br/>
Is to the devil now no farther prize,<br/>
    Since John has lately lost the use of both.<br/>
Debt he calls wealth, and taxes Paradise;<br/>
    And Famine, with her gaunt and bony growth,<br/>
Which stare him in the face, he won&rsquo;t examine,<br/>
Or swears that Ceres hath begotten Famine.<br/>
<br/>
But to the tale:&mdash;great joy unto the camp!<br/>
    To Russian, Tartar, English, French, Cossacque,<br/>
O&rsquo;er whom Suwarrow shone like a gas lamp,<br/>
    Presaging a most luminous attack;<br/>
Or like a wisp along the marsh so damp,<br/>
    Which leads beholders on a boggy walk,<br/>
He flitted to and fro a dancing light,<br/>
Which all who saw it follow&rsquo;d, wrong or right.<br/>
<br/>
But certes matters took a different face;<br/>
    There was enthusiasm and much applause,<br/>
The fleet and camp saluted with great grace,<br/>
    And all presaged good fortune to their cause.<br/>
Within a cannon-shot length of the place<br/>
    They drew, constructed ladders, repair&rsquo;d flaws<br/>
In former works, made new, prepared fascines,<br/>
And all kinds of benevolent machines.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis thus the spirit of a single mind<br/>
    Makes that of multitudes take one direction,<br/>
As roll the waters to the breathing wind,<br/>
    Or roams the herd beneath the bull&rsquo;s protection;<br/>
Or as a little dog will lead the blind,<br/>
    Or a bell-wether form the flock&rsquo;s connection<br/>
By tinkling sounds, when they go forth to victual;<br/>
Such is the sway of your great men o&rsquo;er little.<br/>
<br/>
The whole camp rung with joy; you would have thought<br/>
    That they were going to a marriage feast<br/>
(This metaphor, I think, holds good as aught,<br/>
    Since there is discord after both at least):<br/>
There was not now a luggage boy but sought<br/>
    Danger and spoil with ardour much increased;<br/>
And why? because a little&mdash;odd&mdash;old man,<br/>
Stript to his shirt, was come to lead the van.<br/>
<br/>
But so it was; and every preparation<br/>
    Was made with all alacrity: the first<br/>
Detachment of three columns took its station,<br/>
    And waited but the signal&rsquo;s voice to burst<br/>
Upon the foe: the second&rsquo;s ordination<br/>
    Was also in three columns, with a thirst<br/>
For glory gaping o&rsquo;er a sea of slaughter:<br/>
The third, in columns two, attack&rsquo;d by water.<br/>
<br/>
New batteries were erected, and was held<br/>
    A general council, in which unanimity,<br/>
That stranger to most councils, here prevail&rsquo;d,<br/>
    As sometimes happens in a great extremity;<br/>
And every difficulty being dispell&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Glory began to dawn with due sublimity,<br/>
While Souvaroff, determined to obtain it,<br/>
Was teaching his recruits to use the bayonet<br/>
<br/>
It is an actual fact, that he, commander<br/>
    In chief, in proper person deign&rsquo;d to drill<br/>
The awkward squad, and could afford to squander<br/>
    His time, a corporal&rsquo;s duty to fulfil:<br/>
Just as you&rsquo;d break a sucking salamander<br/>
    To swallow flame, and never take it ill:<br/>
He show&rsquo;d them how to mount a ladder (which<br/>
Was not like Jacob&rsquo;s) or to cross a ditch.<br/>
<br/>
Also he dress&rsquo;d up, for the nonce, fascines<br/>
    Like men with turbans, scimitars, and dirks,<br/>
And made them charge with bayonet these machines,<br/>
    By way of lesson against actual Turks:<br/>
And when well practised in these mimic scenes,<br/>
    He judged them proper to assail the works;<br/>
At which your wise men sneer&rsquo;d in phrases witty:<br/>
He made no answer; but he took the city.<br/>
<br/>
Most things were in this posture on the eve<br/>
    Of the assault, and all the camp was in<br/>
A stern repose; which you would scarce conceive;<br/>
    Yet men resolved to dash through thick and thin<br/>
Are very silent when they once believe<br/>
    That all is settled:&mdash;there was little din,<br/>
For some were thinking of their home and friends,<br/>
And others of themselves and latter ends.<br/>
<br/>
Suwarrow chiefly was on the alert,<br/>
    Surveying, drilling, ordering, jesting, pondering;<br/>
For the man was, we safely may assert,<br/>
    A thing to wonder at beyond most wondering;<br/>
Hero, buffoon, half-demon, and half-dirt,<br/>
    Praying, instructing, desolating, plundering;<br/>
Now Mars, now Momus; and when bent to storm<br/>
A fortress, Harlequin in uniform.<br/>
<br/>
The day before the assault, while upon drill&mdash;<br/>
    For this great conqueror play&rsquo;d the corporal&mdash;<br/>
Some Cossacques, hovering like hawks round a hill,<br/>
    Had met a party towards the twilight&rsquo;s fall,<br/>
One of whom spoke their tongue&mdash;or well or ill,<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas much that he was understood at all;<br/>
But whether from his voice, or speech, or manner,<br/>
They found that he had fought beneath their banner.<br/>
<br/>
Whereon immediately at his request<br/>
    They brought him and his comrades to head-quarters;<br/>
Their dress was Moslem, but you might have guess&rsquo;d<br/>
    That these were merely masquerading Tartars,<br/>
And that beneath each Turkish-fashion&rsquo;d vest<br/>
    Lurk&rsquo;d Christianity; which sometimes barters<br/>
Her inward grace for outward show, and makes<br/>
It difficult to shun some strange mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
Suwarrow, who was standing in his shirt<br/>
    Before a company of Calmucks, drilling,<br/>
Exclaiming, fooling, swearing at the inert,<br/>
    And lecturing on the noble art of killing,&mdash;<br/>
For deeming human clay but common dirt,<br/>
    This great philosopher was thus instilling<br/>
His maxims, which to martial comprehension<br/>
Proved death in battle equal to a pension;&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Suwarrow, when he saw this company<br/>
    Of Cossacques and their prey, turn&rsquo;d round and cast<br/>
Upon them his slow brow and piercing eye:&mdash;<br/>
    &lsquo;Whence come ye?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;From Constantinople last,<br/>
Captives just now escaped,&rsquo; was the reply.<br/>
    &lsquo;What are ye?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What you see us.&rsquo; Briefly pass&rsquo;d<br/>
This dialogue; for he who answer&rsquo;d knew<br/>
To whom he spoke, and made his words but few.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Your names?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Mine &rsquo;s Johnson, and my comrade &rsquo;s Juan;<br/>
    The other two are women, and the third<br/>
Is neither man nor woman.&rsquo; The chief threw on<br/>
    The party a slight glance, then said, &lsquo;I have heard<br/>
Your name before, the second is a new one:<br/>
    To bring the other three here was absurd:<br/>
But let that pass:&mdash;I think I have heard your name<br/>
In the Nikolaiew regiment?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;The same.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;You served at Widdin?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;You led the attack?&rsquo;<br/>
    &lsquo;I did.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What next?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I really hardly know.&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;You were the first i&rsquo; the breach?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I was not slack<br/>
    At least to follow those who might be so.&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;What follow&rsquo;d?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;A shot laid me on my back,<br/>
    And I became a prisoner to the foe.&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;You shall have vengeance, for the town surrounded<br/>
Is twice as strong as that where you were wounded.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Where will you serve?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Where&rsquo;er you please.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I know<br/>
    You like to be the hope of the forlorn,<br/>
And doubtless would be foremost on the foe<br/>
    After the hardships you&rsquo;ve already borne.<br/>
And this young fellow&mdash;say what can he do?<br/>
    He with the beardless chin and garments torn?&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;Why, general, if he hath no greater fault<br/>
In war than love, he had better lead the assault.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;He shall if that he dare.&rsquo; Here Juan bow&rsquo;d<br/>
    Low as the compliment deserved. Suwarrow<br/>
Continued: &lsquo;Your old regiment&rsquo;s allow&rsquo;d,<br/>
    By special providence, to lead to-morrow,<br/>
Or it may be to-night, the assault: I have vow&rsquo;d<br/>
    To several saints, that shortly plough or harrow<br/>
Shall pass o&rsquo;er what was Ismail, and its tusk<br/>
Be unimpeded by the proudest mosque.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;So now, my lads, for glory!&rsquo;&mdash;Here he turn&rsquo;d<br/>
    And drill&rsquo;d away in the most classic Russian,<br/>
Until each high, heroic bosom burn&rsquo;d<br/>
    For cash and conquest, as if from a cushion<br/>
A preacher had held forth (who nobly spurn&rsquo;d<br/>
    All earthly goods save tithes) and bade them push on<br/>
To slay the Pagans who resisted, battering<br/>
The armies of the Christian Empress Catherine.<br/>
<br/>
Johnson, who knew by this long colloquy<br/>
    Himself a favourite, ventured to address<br/>
Suwarrow, though engaged with accents high<br/>
    In his resumed amusement. &lsquo;I confess<br/>
My debt in being thus allow&rsquo;d to die<br/>
    Among the foremost; but if you&rsquo;d express<br/>
Explicitly our several posts, my friend<br/>
And self would know what duty to attend.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Right! I was busy, and forgot. Why, you<br/>
    Will join your former regiment, which should be<br/>
Now under arms. Ho! Katskoff, take him to<br/>
    (Here he call&rsquo;d up a Polish orderly)<br/>
His post, I mean the regiment Nikolaiew:<br/>
    The stranger stripling may remain with me;<br/>
He &rsquo;s a fine boy. The women may be sent<br/>
To the other baggage, or to the sick tent.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
But here a sort of scene began to ensue:<br/>
    The ladies,&mdash;who by no means had been bred<br/>
To be disposed of in a way so new,<br/>
    Although their haram education led<br/>
Doubtless to that of doctrines the most true,<br/>
    Passive obedience,&mdash;now raised up the head,<br/>
With flashing eyes and starting tears, and flung<br/>
Their arms, as hens their wings about their young,<br/>
<br/>
O&rsquo;er the promoted couple of brave men<br/>
    Who were thus honour&rsquo;d by the greatest chief<br/>
That ever peopled hell with heroes slain,<br/>
    Or plunged a province or a realm in grief.<br/>
O, foolish mortals! Always taught in vain!<br/>
    O, glorious laurel! since for one sole leaf<br/>
Of thine imaginary deathless tree,<br/>
Of blood and tears must flow the unebbing sea.<br/>
<br/>
Suwarrow, who had small regard for tears,<br/>
    And not much sympathy for blood, survey&rsquo;d<br/>
The women with their hair about their ears<br/>
    And natural agonies, with a slight shade<br/>
Of feeling: for however habit sears<br/>
    Men&rsquo;s hearts against whole millions, when their trade<br/>
Is butchery, sometimes a single sorrow<br/>
Will touch even heroes&mdash;and such was Suwarrow.<br/>
<br/>
He said,&mdash;and in the kindest Calmuck tone,&mdash;<br/>
    &lsquo;Why, Johnson, what the devil do you mean<br/>
By bringing women here? They shall be shown<br/>
    All the attention possible, and seen<br/>
In safety to the waggons, where alone<br/>
    In fact they can be safe. You should have been<br/>
Aware this kind of baggage never thrives:<br/>
Save wed a year, I hate recruits with wives.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;May it please your excellency,&rsquo; thus replied<br/>
    Our British friend, &lsquo;these are the wives of others,<br/>
And not our own. I am too qualified<br/>
    By service with my military brothers<br/>
To break the rules by bringing one&rsquo;s own bride<br/>
    Into a camp: I know that nought so bothers<br/>
The hearts of the heroic on a charge,<br/>
As leaving a small family at large.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;But these are but two Turkish ladies, who<br/>
    With their attendant aided our escape,<br/>
And afterwards accompanied us through<br/>
    A thousand perils in this dubious shape.<br/>
To me this kind of life is not so new;<br/>
    To them, poor things, it is an awkward scrape.<br/>
I therefore, if you wish me to fight freely,<br/>
Request that they may both be used genteelly.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Meantime these two poor girls, with swimming eyes,<br/>
    Look&rsquo;d on as if in doubt if they could trust<br/>
Their own protectors; nor was their surprise<br/>
    Less than their grief (and truly not less just)<br/>
To see an old man, rather wild than wise<br/>
    In aspect, plainly clad, besmear&rsquo;d with dust,<br/>
Stript to his waistcoat, and that not too clean,<br/>
More fear&rsquo;d than all the sultans ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
For every thing seem&rsquo;d resting on his nod,<br/>
    As they could read in all eyes. Now to them,<br/>
Who were accustom&rsquo;d, as a sort of god,<br/>
    To see the sultan, rich in many a gem,<br/>
Like an imperial peacock stalk abroad<br/>
    (That royal bird, whose tail &rsquo;s a diadem),<br/>
With all the pomp of power, it was a doubt<br/>
How power could condescend to do without.<br/>
<br/>
John Johnson, seeing their extreme dismay,<br/>
    Though little versed in feelings oriental,<br/>
Suggested some slight comfort in his way:<br/>
    Don Juan, who was much more sentimental,<br/>
Swore they should see him by the dawn of day,<br/>
    Or that the Russian army should repent all:<br/>
And, strange to say, they found some consolation<br/>
In this&mdash;for females like exaggeration.<br/>
<br/>
And then with tears, and sighs, and some slight kisses,<br/>
    They parted for the present&mdash;these to await,<br/>
According to the artillery&rsquo;s hits or misses,<br/>
    What sages call Chance, Providence, or Fate<br/>
(Uncertainty is one of many blisses,<br/>
    A mortgage on Humanity&rsquo;s estate)&mdash;<br/>
While their beloved friends began to arm,<br/>
To burn a town which never did them harm.<br/>
<br/>
Suwarrow,&mdash;who but saw things in the gross,<br/>
    Being much too gross to see them in detail,<br/>
Who calculated life as so much dross,<br/>
    And as the wind a widow&rsquo;d nation&rsquo;s wail,<br/>
And cared as little for his army&rsquo;s loss<br/>
    (So that their efforts should at length prevail)<br/>
As wife and friends did for the boils of job,&mdash;<br/>
What was &rsquo;t to him to hear two women sob?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing.&mdash;The work of glory still went on<br/>
    In preparations for a cannonade<br/>
As terrible as that of Ilion,<br/>
    If Homer had found mortars ready made;<br/>
But now, instead of slaying Priam&rsquo;s son,<br/>
    We only can but talk of escalade,<br/>
Bombs, drums, guns, bastions, batteries, bayonets, bullets,&mdash;<br/>
Hard words, which stick in the soft Muses&rsquo; gullets.<br/>
<br/>
O, thou eternal Homer! who couldst charm<br/>
    All cars, though long; all ages, though so short,<br/>
By merely wielding with poetic arm<br/>
    Arms to which men will never more resort,<br/>
Unless gunpowder should be found to harm<br/>
    Much less than is the hope of every court,<br/>
Which now is leagued young Freedom to annoy;<br/>
But they will not find Liberty a Troy:&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
O, thou eternal Homer! I have now<br/>
    To paint a siege, wherein more men were slain,<br/>
With deadlier engines and a speedier blow,<br/>
    Than in thy Greek gazette of that campaign;<br/>
And yet, like all men else, I must allow,<br/>
    To vie with thee would be about as vain<br/>
As for a brook to cope with ocean&rsquo;s flood;<br/>
But still we moderns equal you in blood;<br/>
<br/>
If not in poetry, at least in fact;<br/>
    And fact is truth, the grand desideratum!<br/>
Of which, howe&rsquo;er the Muse describes each act,<br/>
    There should be ne&rsquo;ertheless a slight substratum.<br/>
But now the town is going to be attack&rsquo;d;<br/>
    Great deeds are doing&mdash;how shall I relate &rsquo;em?<br/>
Souls of immortal generals! Phoebus watches<br/>
To colour up his rays from your despatches.<br/>
<br/>
O, ye great bulletins of Bonaparte!<br/>
    O, ye less grand long lists of kill&rsquo;d and wounded!<br/>
Shade of Leonidas, who fought so hearty,<br/>
    When my poor Greece was once, as now, surrounded!<br/>
O, Caesar&rsquo;s Commentaries! now impart, ye<br/>
    Shadows of glory! (lest I be confounded)<br/>
A portion of your fading twilight hues,<br/>
So beautiful, so fleeting, to the Muse.<br/>
<br/>
When I call &lsquo;fading&rsquo; martial immortality,<br/>
    I mean, that every age and every year,<br/>
And almost every day, in sad reality,<br/>
    Some sucking hero is compell&rsquo;d to rear,<br/>
Who, when we come to sum up the totality<br/>
    Of deeds to human happiness most dear,<br/>
Turns out to be a butcher in great business,<br/>
Afflicting young folks with a sort of dizziness.<br/>
<br/>
Medals, rank, ribands, lace, embroidery, scarlet,<br/>
    Are things immortal to immortal man,<br/>
As purple to the Babylonian harlot:<br/>
    An uniform to boys is like a fan<br/>
To women; there is scarce a crimson varlet<br/>
    But deems himself the first in Glory&rsquo;s van.<br/>
But Glory&rsquo;s glory; and if you would find<br/>
What that is&mdash;ask the pig who sees the wind!<br/>
<br/>
At least he feels it, and some say he sees,<br/>
    Because he runs before it like a pig;<br/>
Or, if that simple sentence should displease,<br/>
    Say, that he scuds before it like a brig,<br/>
A schooner, or&mdash;but it is time to ease<br/>
    This Canto, ere my Muse perceives fatigue.<br/>
The next shall ring a peal to shake all people,<br/>
Like a bob-major from a village steeple.<br/>
<br/>
Hark! through the silence of the cold, dull night,<br/>
    The hum of armies gathering rank on rank!<br/>
Lo! dusky masses steal in dubious sight<br/>
    Along the leaguer&rsquo;d wall and bristling bank<br/>
Of the arm&rsquo;d river, while with straggling light<br/>
    The stars peep through the vapours dim and dank,<br/>
Which curl in curious wreaths:&mdash;how soon the smoke<br/>
Of Hell shall pall them in a deeper cloak!<br/>
<br/>
Here pause we for the present&mdash;as even then<br/>
    That awful pause, dividing life from death,<br/>
Struck for an instant on the hearts of men,<br/>
    Thousands of whom were drawing their last breath!<br/>
A moment&mdash;and all will be life again!<br/>
    The march! the charge! the shouts of either faith!<br/>
Hurra! and Allah! and&mdash;one moment more,<br/>
The death-cry drowning in the battle&rsquo;s roar.<br/>

<h2><a name="2H_4_0009"></a>
CANTO THE EIGHTH.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
O blood and thunder! and oh blood and wounds!<br/>
    These are but vulgar oaths, as you may deem,<br/>
Too gentle reader! and most shocking sounds:<br/>
    And so they are; yet thus is Glory&rsquo;s dream<br/>
Unriddled, and as my true Muse expounds<br/>
    At present such things, since they are her theme,<br/>
So be they her inspirers! Call them Mars,<br/>
Bellona, what you will&mdash;they mean but wars.<br/>
<br/>
All was prepared&mdash;the fire, the sword, the men<br/>
    To wield them in their terrible array.<br/>
The army, like a lion from his den,<br/>
    March&rsquo;d forth with nerve and sinews bent to slay,&mdash;<br/>
A human Hydra, issuing from its fen<br/>
    To breathe destruction on its winding way,<br/>
Whose heads were heroes, which cut off in vain<br/>
Immediately in others grew again.<br/>
<br/>
History can only take things in the gross;<br/>
    But could we know them in detail, perchance<br/>
In balancing the profit and the loss,<br/>
    War&rsquo;s merit it by no means might enhance,<br/>
To waste so much gold for a little dross,<br/>
    As hath been done, mere conquest to advance.<br/>
The drying up a single tear has more<br/>
Of honest fame, than shedding seas of gore.<br/>
<br/>
And why?&mdash;because it brings self-approbation;<br/>
    Whereas the other, after all its glare,<br/>
Shouts, bridges, arches, pensions from a nation,<br/>
    Which (it may be) has not much left to spare,<br/>
A higher title, or a loftier station,<br/>
    Though they may make Corruption gape or stare,<br/>
Yet, in the end, except in Freedom&rsquo;s battles,<br/>
Are nothing but a child of Murder&rsquo;s rattles.<br/>
<br/>
And such they are&mdash;and such they will be found:<br/>
    Not so Leonidas and Washington,<br/>
Whose every battle-field is holy ground,<br/>
    Which breathes of nations saved, not worlds undone.<br/>
How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!<br/>
    While the mere victor&rsquo;s may appal or stun<br/>
The servile and the vain, such names will be<br/>
A watchword till the future shall be free.<br/>
<br/>
The night was dark, and the thick mist allow&rsquo;d<br/>
    Nought to be seen save the artillery&rsquo;s flame,<br/>
Which arch&rsquo;d the horizon like a fiery cloud,<br/>
    And in the Danube&rsquo;s waters shone the same&mdash;<br/>
A mirror&rsquo;d hell! the volleying roar, and loud<br/>
    Long booming of each peal on peal, o&rsquo;ercame<br/>
The ear far more than thunder; for Heaven&rsquo;s flashes<br/>
Spare, or smite rarely&mdash;man&rsquo;s make millions ashes!<br/>
<br/>
The column order&rsquo;d on the assault scarce pass&rsquo;d<br/>
    Beyond the Russian batteries a few toises,<br/>
When up the bristling Moslem rose at last,<br/>
    Answering the Christian thunders with like voices:<br/>
Then one vast fire, air, earth, and stream embraced,<br/>
    Which rock&rsquo;d as &rsquo;twere beneath the mighty noises;<br/>
While the whole rampart blazed like Etna, when<br/>
The restless Titan hiccups in his den.<br/>
<br/>
And one enormous shout of &lsquo;Allah!&rsquo; rose<br/>
    In the same moment, loud as even the roar<br/>
Of war&rsquo;s most mortal engines, to their foes<br/>
    Hurling defiance: city, stream, and shore<br/>
Resounded &lsquo;Allah!&rsquo; and the clouds which close<br/>
    With thick&rsquo;ning canopy the conflict o&rsquo;er,<br/>
Vibrate to the Eternal name. Hark! through<br/>
All sounds it pierceth &lsquo;Allah! Allah! Hu!&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
The columns were in movement one and all,<br/>
    But of the portion which attack&rsquo;d by water,<br/>
Thicker than leaves the lives began to fall,<br/>
    Though led by Arseniew, that great son of slaughter,<br/>
As brave as ever faced both bomb and ball.<br/>
    &lsquo;Carnage&rsquo; (so Wordsworth tells you) &lsquo;is God&rsquo;s daughter:&rsquo;<br/>
If he speak truth, she is Christ&rsquo;s sister, and<br/>
Just now behaved as in the Holy Land.<br/>
<br/>
The Prince de Ligne was wounded in the knee;<br/>
    Count Chapeau-Bras, too, had a ball between<br/>
His cap and head, which proves the head to be<br/>
    Aristocratic as was ever seen,<br/>
Because it then received no injury<br/>
    More than the cap; in fact, the ball could mean<br/>
No harm unto a right legitimate head:<br/>
&lsquo;Ashes to ashes&rsquo;&mdash;why not lead to lead?<br/>
<br/>
Also the General Markow, Brigadier,<br/>
    Insisting on removal of the prince<br/>
Amidst some groaning thousands dying near,&mdash;<br/>
    All common fellows, who might writhe and wince,<br/>
And shriek for water into a deaf ear,&mdash;<br/>
    The General Markow, who could thus evince<br/>
His sympathy for rank, by the same token,<br/>
To teach him greater, had his own leg broken.<br/>
<br/>
Three hundred cannon threw up their emetic,<br/>
    And thirty thousand muskets flung their pills<br/>
Like hail, to make a bloody diuretic.<br/>
    Mortality! thou hast thy monthly bills;<br/>
Thy plagues, thy famines, thy physicians, yet tick,<br/>
    Like the death-watch, within our ears the ills<br/>
Past, present, and to come;&mdash;but all may yield<br/>
To the true portrait of one battle-field.<br/>
<br/>
There the still varying pangs, which multiply<br/>
    Until their very number makes men hard<br/>
By the infinities of agony,<br/>
    Which meet the gaze whate&rsquo;er it may regard&mdash;<br/>
The groan, the roll in dust, the all-white eye<br/>
    Turn&rsquo;d back within its socket,&mdash;these reward<br/>
Your rank and file by thousands, while the rest<br/>
May win perhaps a riband at the breast!<br/>
<br/>
Yet I love glory;&mdash;glory &rsquo;s a great thing:&mdash;<br/>
    Think what it is to be in your old age<br/>
Maintain&rsquo;d at the expense of your good king:<br/>
    A moderate pension shakes full many a sage,<br/>
And heroes are but made for bards to sing,<br/>
    Which is still better; thus in verse to wage<br/>
Your wars eternally, besides enjoying<br/>
Half-pay for life, make mankind worth destroying.<br/>
<br/>
The troops, already disembark&rsquo;d, push&rsquo;d on<br/>
    To take a battery on the right; the others,<br/>
Who landed lower down, their landing done,<br/>
    Had set to work as briskly as their brothers:<br/>
Being grenadiers, they mounted one by one,<br/>
    Cheerful as children climb the breasts of mothers,<br/>
O&rsquo;er the entrenchment and the palisade,<br/>
Quite orderly, as if upon parade.<br/>
<br/>
And this was admirable; for so hot<br/>
    The fire was, that were red Vesuvius loaded,<br/>
Besides its lava, with all sorts of shot<br/>
    And shells or hells, it could not more have goaded.<br/>
Of officers a third fell on the spot,<br/>
    A thing which victory by no means boded<br/>
To gentlemen engaged in the assault:<br/>
Hounds, when the huntsman tumbles, are at fault.<br/>
<br/>
But here I leave the general concern,<br/>
    To track our hero on his path of fame:<br/>
He must his laurels separately earn;<br/>
    For fifty thousand heroes, name by name,<br/>
Though all deserving equally to turn<br/>
    A couplet, or an elegy to claim,<br/>
Would form a lengthy lexicon of glory,<br/>
And what is worse still, a much longer story:<br/>
<br/>
And therefore we must give the greater number<br/>
    To the Gazette&mdash;which doubtless fairly dealt<br/>
By the deceased, who lie in famous slumber<br/>
    In ditches, fields, or wheresoe&rsquo;er they felt<br/>
Their clay for the last time their souls encumber;&mdash;<br/>
    Thrice happy he whose name has been well spelt<br/>
In the despatch: I knew a man whose loss<br/>
Was printed Grove, although his name was Grose.<br/>
<br/>
Juan and Johnson join&rsquo;d a certain corps,<br/>
    And fought away with might and main, not knowing<br/>
The way which they had never trod before,<br/>
    And still less guessing where they might be going;<br/>
But on they march&rsquo;d, dead bodies trampling o&rsquo;er,<br/>
    Firing, and thrusting, slashing, sweating, glowing,<br/>
But fighting thoughtlessly enough to win,<br/>
To their two selves, one whole bright bulletin.<br/>
<br/>
Thus on they wallow&rsquo;d in the bloody mire<br/>
    Of dead and dying thousands,&mdash;sometimes gaining<br/>
A yard or two of ground, which brought them nigher<br/>
    To some odd angle for which all were straining;<br/>
At other times, repulsed by the close fire,<br/>
    Which really pour&rsquo;d as if all hell were raining<br/>
Instead of heaven, they stumbled backwards o&rsquo;er<br/>
A wounded comrade, sprawling in his gore.<br/>
<br/>
Though &rsquo;twas Don Juan&rsquo;s first of fields, and though<br/>
    The nightly muster and the silent march<br/>
In the chill dark, when courage does not glow<br/>
    So much as under a triumphal arch,<br/>
Perhaps might make him shiver, yawn, or throw<br/>
    A glance on the dull clouds (as thick as starch,<br/>
Which stiffen&rsquo;d heaven) as if he wish&rsquo;d for day;&mdash;<br/>
Yet for all this he did not run away.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed he could not. But what if he had?<br/>
    There have been and are heroes who begun<br/>
With something not much better, or as bad:<br/>
    Frederic the Great from Molwitz deign&rsquo;d to run,<br/>
For the first and last time; for, like a pad,<br/>
    Or hawk, or bride, most mortals after one<br/>
Warm bout are broken into their new tricks,<br/>
And fight like fiends for pay or politics.<br/>
<br/>
He was what Erin calls, in her sublime<br/>
    Old Erse or Irish, or it may be Punic<br/>
(The antiquarians who can settle time,<br/>
    Which settles all things, Roman, Greek, or Runic,<br/>
Swear that Pat&rsquo;s language sprung from the same clime<br/>
    With Hannibal, and wears the Tyrian tunic<br/>
Of Dido&rsquo;s alphabet; and this is rational<br/>
As any other notion, and not national);&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
But Juan was quite &lsquo;a broth of a boy,&rsquo;<br/>
    A thing of impulse and a child of song;<br/>
Now swimming in the sentiment of joy,<br/>
    Or the sensation (if that phrase seem wrong),<br/>
And afterward, if he must needs destroy,<br/>
    In such good company as always throng<br/>
To battles, sieges, and that kind of pleasure,<br/>
No less delighted to employ his leisure;<br/>
<br/>
But always without malice: if he warr&rsquo;d<br/>
    Or loved, it was with what we call &lsquo;the best<br/>
Intentions,&rsquo; which form all mankind&rsquo;s trump card,<br/>
    To be produced when brought up to the test.<br/>
The statesman, hero, harlot, lawyer&mdash;ward<br/>
    Off each attack, when people are in quest<br/>
Of their designs, by saying they meant well;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis pity &lsquo;that such meaning should pave hell.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
I almost lately have begun to doubt<br/>
    Whether hell&rsquo;s pavement&mdash;if it be so paved&mdash;<br/>
Must not have latterly been quite worn out,<br/>
    Not by the numbers good intent hath saved,<br/>
But by the mass who go below without<br/>
    Those ancient good intentions, which once shaved<br/>
And smooth&rsquo;d the brimstone of that street of hell<br/>
Which bears the greatest likeness to Pall Mall.<br/>
<br/>
Juan, by some strange chance, which oft divides<br/>
    Warrior from warrior in their grim career,<br/>
Like chastest wives from constant husbands&rsquo; sides<br/>
    Just at the close of the first bridal year,<br/>
By one of those odd turns of Fortune&rsquo;s tides,<br/>
    Was on a sudden rather puzzled here,<br/>
When, after a good deal of heavy firing,<br/>
He found himself alone, and friends retiring.<br/>
<br/>
I don&rsquo;t know how the thing occurr&rsquo;d&mdash;it might<br/>
    Be that the greater part were kill&rsquo;d or wounded,<br/>
And that the rest had faced unto the right<br/>
    About; a circumstance which has confounded<br/>
Caesar himself, who, in the very sight<br/>
    Of his whole army, which so much abounded<br/>
In courage, was obliged to snatch a shield,<br/>
And rally back his Romans to the field.<br/>
<br/>
Juan, who had no shield to snatch, and was<br/>
    No Caesar, but a fine young lad, who fought<br/>
He knew not why, arriving at this pass,<br/>
    Stopp&rsquo;d for a minute, as perhaps he ought<br/>
For a much longer time; then, like an as<br/>
    (Start not, kind reader; since great Homer thought<br/>
This simile enough for Ajax, Juan<br/>
Perhaps may find it better than a new one)&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Then, like an ass, he went upon his way,<br/>
    And, what was stranger, never look&rsquo;d behind;<br/>
But seeing, flashing forward, like the day<br/>
    Over the hills, a fire enough to blind<br/>
Those who dislike to look upon a fray,<br/>
    He stumbled on, to try if he could find<br/>
A path, to add his own slight arm and forces<br/>
To corps, the greater part of which were corses.<br/>
<br/>
Perceiving then no more the commandant<br/>
    Of his own corps, nor even the corps, which had<br/>
Quite disappear&rsquo;d&mdash;the gods know howl (I can&rsquo;t<br/>
    Account for every thing which may look bad<br/>
In history; but we at least may grant<br/>
    It was not marvellous that a mere lad,<br/>
In search of glory, should look on before,<br/>
Nor care a pinch of snuff about his corps):&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Perceiving nor commander nor commanded,<br/>
    And left at large, like a young heir, to make<br/>
His way to&mdash;where he knew not&mdash;single handed;<br/>
    As travellers follow over bog and brake<br/>
An &lsquo;ignis fatuus;&rsquo; or as sailors stranded<br/>
    Unto the nearest hut themselves betake;<br/>
So Juan, following honour and his nose,<br/>
Rush&rsquo;d where the thickest fire announced most foes.<br/>
<br/>
He knew not where he was, nor greatly cared,<br/>
    For he was dizzy, busy, and his veins<br/>
Fill&rsquo;d as with lightning&mdash;for his spirit shared<br/>
    The hour, as is the case with lively brains;<br/>
And where the hottest fire was seen and heard,<br/>
    And the loud cannon peal&rsquo;d his hoarsest strains,<br/>
He rush&rsquo;d, while earth and air were sadly shaken<br/>
By thy humane discovery, Friar Bacon!<br/>
<br/>
And as he rush&rsquo;d along, it came to pass he<br/>
    Fell in with what was late the second column,<br/>
Under the orders of the General Lascy,<br/>
    But now reduced, as is a bulky volume<br/>
Into an elegant extract (much less massy)<br/>
    Of heroism, and took his place with solemn<br/>
Air &rsquo;midst the rest, who kept their valiant faces<br/>
And levell&rsquo;d weapons still against the glacis.<br/>
<br/>
Just at this crisis up came Johnson too,<br/>
    Who had &lsquo;retreated,&rsquo; as the phrase is when<br/>
Men run away much rather than go through<br/>
    Destruction&rsquo;s jaws into the devil&rsquo;s den;<br/>
But Johnson was a clever fellow, who<br/>
    Knew when and how &lsquo;to cut and come again,&rsquo;<br/>
And never ran away, except when running<br/>
Was nothing but a valorous kind of cunning.<br/>
<br/>
And so, when all his corps were dead or dying,<br/>
    Except Don Juan, a mere novice, whose<br/>
More virgin valour never dreamt of flying<br/>
    From ignorance of danger, which indues<br/>
Its votaries, like innocence relying<br/>
    On its own strength, with careless nerves and thews,&mdash;<br/>
Johnson retired a little, just to rally<br/>
Those who catch cold in &lsquo;shadows of Death&rsquo;s valley.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
And there, a little shelter&rsquo;d from the shot,<br/>
    Which rain&rsquo;d from bastion, battery, parapet,<br/>
Rampart, wall, casement, house,&mdash;for there was not<br/>
    In this extensive city, sore beset<br/>
By Christian soldiery, a single spot<br/>
    Which did not combat like the devil, as yet,<br/>
He found a number of Chasseurs, all scatter&rsquo;d<br/>
By the resistance of the chase they batter&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
And these he call&rsquo;d on; and, what &rsquo;s strange, they came<br/>
    Unto his call, unlike &lsquo;the spirits from<br/>
The vasty deep,&rsquo; to whom you may exclaim,<br/>
    Says Hotspur, long ere they will leave their home.<br/>
Their reasons were uncertainty, or shame<br/>
    At shrinking from a bullet or a bomb,<br/>
And that odd impulse, which in wars or creeds<br/>
Makes men, like cattle, follow him who leads.<br/>
<br/>
By Jove! he was a noble fellow, Johnson,<br/>
    And though his name, than Ajax or Achilles,<br/>
Sounds less harmonious, underneath the sun soon<br/>
    We shall not see his likeness: he could kill his<br/>
Man quite as quietly as blows the monsoon<br/>
    Her steady breath (which some months the same still is):<br/>
Seldom he varied feature, hue, or muscle,<br/>
And could be very busy without bustle;<br/>
<br/>
And therefore, when he ran away, he did so<br/>
    Upon reflection, knowing that behind<br/>
He would find others who would fain be rid so<br/>
    Of idle apprehensions, which like wind<br/>
Trouble heroic stomachs. Though their lids so<br/>
    Oft are soon closed, all heroes are not blind,<br/>
But when they light upon immediate death,<br/>
Retire a little, merely to take breath.<br/>
<br/>
But Johnson only ran off, to return<br/>
    With many other warriors, as we said,<br/>
Unto that rather somewhat misty bourn,<br/>
    Which Hamlet tells us is a pass of dread.<br/>
To Jack howe&rsquo;er this gave but slight concern:<br/>
    His soul (like galvanism upon the dead)<br/>
Acted upon the living as on wire,<br/>
And led them back into the heaviest fire.<br/>
<br/>
Egad! they found the second time what they<br/>
    The first time thought quite terrible enough<br/>
To fly from, malgre all which people say<br/>
    Of glory, and all that immortal stuff<br/>
Which fills a regiment (besides their pay,<br/>
    That daily shilling which makes warriors tough)&mdash;<br/>
They found on their return the self-same welcome,<br/>
Which made some think, and others know, a hell come.<br/>
<br/>
They fell as thick as harvests beneath hail,<br/>
    Grass before scythes, or corn below the sickle,<br/>
Proving that trite old truth, that life &rsquo;s as frail<br/>
    As any other boon for which men stickle.<br/>
The Turkish batteries thrash&rsquo;d them like a flail,<br/>
    Or a good boxer, into a sad pickle<br/>
Putting the very bravest, who were knock&rsquo;d<br/>
Upon the head, before their guns were cock&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
The Turks, behind the traverses and flanks<br/>
    Of the next bastion, fired away like devils,<br/>
And swept, as gales sweep foam away, whole ranks:<br/>
    However, Heaven knows how, the Fate who levels<br/>
Towns, nations, worlds, in her revolving pranks,<br/>
    So order&rsquo;d it, amidst these sulphury revels,<br/>
That Johnson and some few who had not scamper&rsquo;d,<br/>
Reach&rsquo;d the interior talus of the rampart.<br/>
<br/>
First one or two, then five, six, and a dozen,<br/>
    Came mounting quickly up, for it was now<br/>
All neck or nothing, as, like pitch or rosin,<br/>
    Flame was shower&rsquo;d forth above, as well &rsquo;s below,<br/>
So that you scarce could say who best had chosen,<br/>
    The gentlemen that were the first to show<br/>
Their martial faces on the parapet,<br/>
Or those who thought it brave to wait as yet.<br/>
<br/>
But those who scaled, found out that their advance<br/>
    Was favour&rsquo;d by an accident or blunder:<br/>
The Greek or Turkish Cohorn&rsquo;s ignorance<br/>
    Had palisado&rsquo;d in a way you&rsquo;d wonder<br/>
To see in forts of Netherlands or France<br/>
    (Though these to our Gibraltar must knock under)&mdash;<br/>
Right in the middle of the parapet<br/>
Just named, these palisades were primly set:<br/>
<br/>
So that on either side some nine or ten<br/>
    Paces were left, whereon you could contrive<br/>
To march; a great convenience to our men,<br/>
    At least to all those who were left alive,<br/>
Who thus could form a line and fight again;<br/>
    And that which farther aided them to strive<br/>
Was, that they could kick down the palisades,<br/>
Which scarcely rose much higher than grass blades.<br/>
<br/>
Among the first,&mdash;I will not say the first,<br/>
    For such precedence upon such occasions<br/>
Will oftentimes make deadly quarrels burst<br/>
    Out between friends as well as allied nations:<br/>
The Briton must be bold who really durst<br/>
    Put to such trial John Bull&rsquo;s partial patience,<br/>
As say that Wellington at Waterloo<br/>
Was beaten&mdash;though the Prussians say so too;&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
And that if Blucher, Bulow, Gneisenau,<br/>
    And God knows who besides in &lsquo;au&rsquo; and &lsquo;ow,&rsquo;<br/>
Had not come up in time to cast an awe<br/>
    Into the hearts of those who fought till now<br/>
As tigers combat with an empty craw,<br/>
    The Duke of Wellington had ceased to show<br/>
His orders, also to receive his pensions,<br/>
Which are the heaviest that our history mentions.<br/>
<br/>
But never mind;&mdash;&lsquo;God save the king!&rsquo; and kings!<br/>
    For if he don&rsquo;t, I doubt if men will longer&mdash;<br/>
I think I hear a little bird, who sings<br/>
    The people by and by will be the stronger:<br/>
The veriest jade will wince whose harness wrings<br/>
    So much into the raw as quite to wrong her<br/>
Beyond the rules of posting,&mdash;and the mob<br/>
At last fall sick of imitating Job.<br/>
<br/>
At first it grumbles, then it swears, and then,<br/>
    Like David, flings smooth pebbles &rsquo;gainst a giant;<br/>
At last it takes to weapons such as men<br/>
    Snatch when despair makes human hearts less pliant.<br/>
Then comes &lsquo;the tug of war;&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;twill come again,<br/>
    I rather doubt; and I would fain say &lsquo;fie on &rsquo;t,&rsquo;<br/>
If I had not perceived that revolution<br/>
Alone can save the earth from hell&rsquo;s pollution.<br/>
<br/>
But to continue:&mdash;I say not the first,<br/>
    But of the first, our little friend Don Juan<br/>
Walk&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the walls of Ismail, as if nursed<br/>
    Amidst such scenes&mdash;though this was quite a new one<br/>
To him, and I should hope to most. The thirst<br/>
    Of glory, which so pierces through and through one,<br/>
Pervaded him&mdash;although a generous creature,<br/>
As warm in heart as feminine in feature.<br/>
<br/>
And here he was&mdash;who upon woman&rsquo;s breast,<br/>
    Even from a child, felt like a child; howe&rsquo;er<br/>
The man in all the rest might be confest,<br/>
    To him it was Elysium to be there;<br/>
And he could even withstand that awkward test<br/>
    Which Rousseau points out to the dubious fair,<br/>
&lsquo;Observe your lover when he leaves your arms;&rsquo;<br/>
But Juan never left them, while they had charms,<br/>
<br/>
Unless compell&rsquo;d by fate, or wave, or wind,<br/>
    Or near relations, who are much the same.<br/>
But here he was!&mdash;where each tie that can bind<br/>
    Humanity must yield to steel and flame:<br/>
And he whose very body was all mind,<br/>
    Flung here by fate or circumstance, which tame<br/>
The loftiest, hurried by the time and place,<br/>
Dash&rsquo;d on like a spurr&rsquo;d blood-horse in a race.<br/>
<br/>
So was his blood stirr&rsquo;d while he found resistance,<br/>
    As is the hunter&rsquo;s at the five-bar gate,<br/>
Or double post and rail, where the existence<br/>
    Of Britain&rsquo;s youth depends upon their weight,<br/>
The lightest being the safest: at a distance<br/>
    He hated cruelty, as all men hate<br/>
Blood, until heated&mdash;and even then his own<br/>
At times would curdle o&rsquo;er some heavy groan.<br/>
<br/>
The General Lascy, who had been hard press&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Seeing arrive an aid so opportune<br/>
As were some hundred youngsters all abreast,<br/>
    Who came as if just dropp&rsquo;d down from the moon,<br/>
To Juan, who was nearest him, address&rsquo;d<br/>
    His thanks, and hopes to take the city soon,<br/>
Not reckoning him to be a &lsquo;base Bezonian&rsquo;<br/>
(As Pistol calls it), but a young Livonian.<br/>
<br/>
Juan, to whom he spoke in German, knew<br/>
    As much of German as of Sanscrit, and<br/>
In answer made an inclination to<br/>
    The general who held him in command;<br/>
For seeing one with ribands, black and blue,<br/>
    Stars, medals, and a bloody sword in hand,<br/>
Addressing him in tones which seem&rsquo;d to thank,<br/>
He recognised an officer of rank.<br/>
<br/>
Short speeches pass between two men who speak<br/>
    No common language; and besides, in time<br/>
Of war and taking towns, when many a shriek<br/>
    Rings o&rsquo;er the dialogue, and many a crime<br/>
Is perpetrated ere a word can break<br/>
    Upon the ear, and sounds of horror chime<br/>
In like church-bells, with sigh, howl, groan, yell, prayer,<br/>
There cannot be much conversation there.<br/>
<br/>
And therefore all we have related in<br/>
    Two long octaves, pass&rsquo;d in a little minute;<br/>
But in the same small minute, every sin<br/>
    Contrived to get itself comprised within it.<br/>
The very cannon, deafen&rsquo;d by the din,<br/>
    Grew dumb, for you might almost hear a linnet,<br/>
As soon as thunder, &rsquo;midst the general noise<br/>
Of human nature&rsquo;s agonising voice!<br/>
<br/>
The town was enter&rsquo;d. Oh eternity!-<br/>
    &lsquo;God made the country and man made the town,&rsquo;<br/>
So Cowper says&mdash;and I begin to be<br/>
    Of his opinion, when I see cast down<br/>
Rome, Babylon, Tyre, Carthage, Nineveh,<br/>
    All walls men know, and many never known;<br/>
And pondering on the present and the past,<br/>
To deem the woods shall be our home at last<br/>
<br/>
Of all men, saving Sylla the man-slayer,<br/>
    Who passes for in life and death most lucky,<br/>
Of the great names which in our faces stare,<br/>
    The General Boon, back-woodsman of Kentucky,<br/>
Was happiest amongst mortals anywhere;<br/>
    For killing nothing but a bear or buck, he<br/>
Enjoy&rsquo;d the lonely, vigorous, harmless days<br/>
Of his old age in wilds of deepest maze.<br/>
<br/>
Crime came not near him&mdash;she is not the child<br/>
    Of solitude; Health shrank not from him&mdash;for<br/>
Her home is in the rarely trodden wild,<br/>
    Where if men seek her not, and death be more<br/>
Their choice than life, forgive them, as beguiled<br/>
    By habit to what their own hearts abhor&mdash;<br/>
In cities caged. The present case in point I<br/>
Cite is, that Boon lived hunting up to ninety;<br/>
<br/>
And what &rsquo;s still stranger, left behind a name<br/>
    For which men vainly decimate the throng,<br/>
Not only famous, but of that good fame,<br/>
    Without which glory &rsquo;s but a tavern song&mdash;<br/>
Simple, serene, the antipodes of shame,<br/>
    Which hate nor envy e&rsquo;er could tinge with wrong;<br/>
An active hermit, even in age the child<br/>
Of Nature, or the man of Ross run wild.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis true he shrank from men even of his nation,<br/>
    When they built up unto his darling trees,&mdash;<br/>
He moved some hundred miles off, for a station<br/>
    Where there were fewer houses and more ease;<br/>
The inconvenience of civilisation<br/>
    Is, that you neither can be pleased nor please;<br/>
But where he met the individual man,<br/>
He show&rsquo;d himself as kind as mortal can.<br/>
<br/>
He was not all alone: around him grew<br/>
    A sylvan tribe of children of the chase,<br/>
Whose young, unwaken&rsquo;d world was ever new,<br/>
    Nor sword nor sorrow yet had left a trace<br/>
On her unwrinkled brow, nor could you view<br/>
    A frown on Nature&rsquo;s or on human face;<br/>
The free-born forest found and kept them free,<br/>
And fresh as is a torrent or a tree.<br/>
<br/>
And tall, and strong, and swift of foot were they,<br/>
    Beyond the dwarfing city&rsquo;s pale abortions,<br/>
Because their thoughts had never been the prey<br/>
    Of care or gain: the green woods were their portions;<br/>
No sinking spirits told them they grew grey,<br/>
    No fashion made them apes of her distortions;<br/>
Simple they were, not savage; and their rifles,<br/>
Though very true, were not yet used for trifles.<br/>
<br/>
Motion was in their days, rest in their slumbers,<br/>
    And cheerfulness the handmaid of their toil;<br/>
Nor yet too many nor too few their numbers;<br/>
    Corruption could not make their hearts her soil;<br/>
The lust which stings, the splendour which encumbers,<br/>
    With the free foresters divide no spoil;<br/>
Serene, not sullen, were the solitudes<br/>
Of this unsighing people of the woods.<br/>
<br/>
So much for Nature:&mdash;by way of variety,<br/>
    Now back to thy great joys, Civilisation!<br/>
And the sweet consequence of large society,<br/>
    War, pestilence, the despot&rsquo;s desolation,<br/>
The kingly scourge, the lust of notoriety,<br/>
    The millions slain by soldiers for their ration,<br/>
The scenes like Catherine&rsquo;s boudoir at threescore,<br/>
With Ismail&rsquo;s storm to soften it the more.<br/>
<br/>
The town was enter&rsquo;d: first one column made<br/>
    Its sanguinary way good&mdash;then another;<br/>
The reeking bayonet and the flashing blade<br/>
    Clash&rsquo;d &rsquo;gainst the scimitar, and babe and mother<br/>
With distant shrieks were heard Heaven to upbraid:<br/>
    Still closer sulphury clouds began to smother<br/>
The breath of morn and man, where foot by foot<br/>
The madden&rsquo;d Turks their city still dispute.<br/>
<br/>
Koutousow, he who afterward beat back<br/>
    (With some assistance from the frost and snow)<br/>
Napoleon on his bold and bloody track,<br/>
    It happen&rsquo;d was himself beat back just now;<br/>
He was a jolly fellow, and could crack<br/>
    His jest alike in face of friend or foe,<br/>
Though life, and death, and victory were at stake;<br/>
But here it seem&rsquo;d his jokes had ceased to take:<br/>
<br/>
For having thrown himself into a ditch,<br/>
    Follow&rsquo;d in haste by various grenadiers,<br/>
Whose blood the puddle greatly did enrich,<br/>
    He climb&rsquo;d to where the parapet appears;<br/>
But there his project reach&rsquo;d its utmost pitch<br/>
    (&rsquo;Mongst other deaths the General Ribaupierre&rsquo;s<br/>
Was much regretted), for the Moslem men<br/>
Threw them all down into the ditch again.<br/>
<br/>
And had it not been for some stray troops landing<br/>
    They knew not where, being carried by the stream<br/>
To some spot, where they lost their understanding,<br/>
    And wander&rsquo;d up and down as in a dream,<br/>
Until they reach&rsquo;d, as daybreak was expanding,<br/>
    That which a portal to their eyes did seem,&mdash;<br/>
The great and gay Koutousow might have lain<br/>
Where three parts of his column yet remain.<br/>
<br/>
And scrambling round the rampart, these same troops,<br/>
    After the taking of the &lsquo;Cavalier,&rsquo;<br/>
Just as Koutousow&rsquo;s most &lsquo;forlorn&rsquo; of &lsquo;hopes&rsquo;<br/>
    Took like chameleons some slight tinge of fear,<br/>
Open&rsquo;d the gate call&rsquo;d &lsquo;Kilia,&rsquo; to the groups<br/>
    Of baffled heroes, who stood shyly near,<br/>
Sliding knee-deep in lately frozen mud,<br/>
Now thaw&rsquo;d into a marsh of human blood.<br/>
<br/>
The Kozacks, or, if so you please, Cossacques<br/>
    (I don&rsquo;t much pique myself upon orthography,<br/>
So that I do not grossly err in facts,<br/>
    Statistics, tactics, politics, and geography)&mdash;<br/>
Having been used to serve on horses&rsquo; backs,<br/>
    And no great dilettanti in topography<br/>
Of fortresses, but fighting where it pleases<br/>
Their chiefs to order,&mdash;were all cut to pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Their column, though the Turkish batteries thunder&rsquo;d<br/>
    Upon them, ne&rsquo;ertheless had reach&rsquo;d the rampart,<br/>
And naturally thought they could have plunder&rsquo;d<br/>
    The city, without being farther hamper&rsquo;d;<br/>
But as it happens to brave men, they blunder&rsquo;d&mdash;<br/>
    The Turks at first pretended to have scamper&rsquo;d,<br/>
Only to draw them &rsquo;twixt two bastion corners,<br/>
From whence they sallied on those Christian scorners.<br/>
<br/>
Then being taken by the tail&mdash;a taking<br/>
    Fatal to bishops as to soldiers&mdash;these<br/>
Cossacques were all cut off as day was breaking,<br/>
    And found their lives were let at a short lease&mdash;<br/>
But perish&rsquo;d without shivering or shaking,<br/>
    Leaving as ladders their heap&rsquo;d carcasses,<br/>
O&rsquo;er which Lieutenant-Colonel Yesouskoi<br/>
March&rsquo;d with the brave battalion of Polouzki:&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
This valiant man kill&rsquo;d all the Turks he met,<br/>
    But could not eat them, being in his turn<br/>
Slain by some Mussulmans, who would not yet,<br/>
    Without resistance, see their city burn.<br/>
The walls were won, but &rsquo;twas an even bet<br/>
    Which of the armies would have cause to mourn:<br/>
&rsquo;Twas blow for blow, disputing inch by inch,<br/>
For one would not retreat, nor t&rsquo; other flinch.<br/>
<br/>
Another column also suffer&rsquo;d much:&mdash;<br/>
    And here we may remark with the historian,<br/>
You should but give few cartridges to such<br/>
    Troops as are meant to march with greatest glory on:<br/>
When matters must be carried by the touch<br/>
    Of the bright bayonet, and they all should hurry on,<br/>
They sometimes, with a hankering for existence,<br/>
Keep merely firing at a foolish distance.<br/>
<br/>
A junction of the General Meknop&rsquo;s men<br/>
    (Without the General, who had fallen some time<br/>
Before, being badly seconded just then)<br/>
    Was made at length with those who dared to climb<br/>
The death-disgorging rampart once again;<br/>
    And though the Turk&rsquo;s resistance was sublime,<br/>
They took the bastion, which the Seraskier<br/>
Defended at a price extremely dear.<br/>
<br/>
Juan and Johnson, and some volunteers,<br/>
    Among the foremost, offer&rsquo;d him good quarter,<br/>
A word which little suits with Seraskiers,<br/>
    Or at least suited not this valiant Tartar.<br/>
He died, deserving well his country&rsquo;s tears,<br/>
    A savage sort of military martyr.<br/>
An English naval officer, who wish&rsquo;d<br/>
To make him prisoner, was also dish&rsquo;d:<br/>
<br/>
For all the answer to his proposition<br/>
    Was from a pistol-shot that laid him dead;<br/>
On which the rest, without more intermission,<br/>
    Began to lay about with steel and lead&mdash;<br/>
The pious metals most in requisition<br/>
    On such occasions: not a single head<br/>
Was spared;&mdash;three thousand Moslems perish&rsquo;d here,<br/>
And sixteen bayonets pierced the Seraskier.<br/>
<br/>
The city &rsquo;s taken&mdash;only part by part&mdash;<br/>
    And death is drunk with gore: there&rsquo;s not a street<br/>
Where fights not to the last some desperate heart<br/>
    For those for whom it soon shall cease to beat.<br/>
Here War forgot his own destructive art<br/>
    In more destroying Nature; and the heat<br/>
Of carnage, like the Nile&rsquo;s sun-sodden slime,<br/>
Engender&rsquo;d monstrous shapes of every crime.<br/>
<br/>
A Russian officer, in martial tread<br/>
    Over a heap of bodies, felt his heel<br/>
Seized fast, as if &rsquo;twere by the serpent&rsquo;s head<br/>
    Whose fangs Eve taught her human seed to feel:<br/>
In vain he kick&rsquo;d, and swore, and writhed, and bled,<br/>
    And howl&rsquo;d for help as wolves do for a meal&mdash;<br/>
The teeth still kept their gratifying hold,<br/>
As do the subtle snakes described of old.<br/>
<br/>
A dying Moslem, who had felt the foot<br/>
    Of a foe o&rsquo;er him, snatch&rsquo;d at it, and bit<br/>
The very tendon which is most acute<br/>
    (That which some ancient Muse or modern wit<br/>
Named after thee, Achilles), and quite through &rsquo;t<br/>
    He made the teeth meet, nor relinquish&rsquo;d it<br/>
Even with his life&mdash;for (but they lie) &rsquo;tis said<br/>
To the live leg still clung the sever&rsquo;d head.<br/>
<br/>
However this may be, &rsquo;tis pretty sure<br/>
    The Russian officer for life was lamed,<br/>
For the Turk&rsquo;s teeth stuck faster than a skewer,<br/>
    And left him &rsquo;midst the invalid and maim&rsquo;d:<br/>
The regimental surgeon could not cure<br/>
    His patient, and perhaps was to be blamed<br/>
More than the head of the inveterate foe,<br/>
Which was cut off, and scarce even then let go.<br/>
<br/>
But then the fact &rsquo;s a fact&mdash;and &rsquo;tis the part<br/>
    Of a true poet to escape from fiction<br/>
Whene&rsquo;er he can; for there is little art<br/>
    In leaving verse more free from the restriction<br/>
Of truth than prose, unless to suit the mart<br/>
    For what is sometimes called poetic diction,<br/>
And that outrageous appetite for lies<br/>
Which Satan angles with for souls, like flies.<br/>
<br/>
The city &rsquo;s taken, but not render&rsquo;d!&mdash;No!<br/>
    There&rsquo;s not a Moslem that hath yielded sword:<br/>
The blood may gush out, as the Danube&rsquo;s flow<br/>
    Rolls by the city wall; but deed nor word<br/>
Acknowledge aught of dread of death or foe:<br/>
    In vain the yell of victory is roar&rsquo;d<br/>
By the advancing Muscovite&mdash;the groan<br/>
Of the last foe is echoed by his own.<br/>
<br/>
The bayonet pierces and the sabre cleaves,<br/>
    And human lives are lavish&rsquo;d everywhere,<br/>
As the year closing whirls the scarlet leaves<br/>
    When the stripp&rsquo;d forest bows to the bleak air,<br/>
And groans; and thus the peopled city grieves,<br/>
    Shorn of its best and loveliest, and left bare;<br/>
But still it falls in vast and awful splinters,<br/>
As oaks blown down with all their thousand winters.<br/>
<br/>
It is an awful topic&mdash;but &rsquo;tis not<br/>
    My cue for any time to be terrific:<br/>
For checker&rsquo;d as is seen our human lot<br/>
    With good, and bad, and worse, alike prolific<br/>
Of melancholy merriment, to quote<br/>
    Too much of one sort would be soporific;&mdash;<br/>
Without, or with, offence to friends or foes,<br/>
I sketch your world exactly as it goes.<br/>
<br/>
And one good action in the midst of crimes<br/>
    Is &lsquo;quite refreshing,&rsquo; in the affected phrase<br/>
Of these ambrosial, Pharisaic times,<br/>
    With all their pretty milk-and-water ways,<br/>
And may serve therefore to bedew these rhymes,<br/>
    A little scorch&rsquo;d at present with the blaze<br/>
Of conquest and its consequences, which<br/>
Make epic poesy so rare and rich.<br/>
<br/>
Upon a taken bastion, where there lay<br/>
    Thousands of slaughter&rsquo;d men, a yet warm group<br/>
Of murder&rsquo;d women, who had found their way<br/>
    To this vain refuge, made the good heart droop<br/>
And shudder;&mdash;while, as beautiful as May,<br/>
    A female child of ten years tried to stoop<br/>
And hide her little palpitating breast<br/>
Amidst the bodies lull&rsquo;d in bloody rest.<br/>
<br/>
Two villainous Cossacques pursued the child<br/>
    With flashing eyes and weapons: match&rsquo;d with them,<br/>
The rudest brute that roams Siberia&rsquo;s wild<br/>
    Has feelings pure and polish&rsquo;d as a gem,&mdash;<br/>
The bear is civilised, the wolf is mild;<br/>
    And whom for this at last must we condemn?<br/>
Their natures? or their sovereigns, who employ<br/>
All arts to teach their subjects to destroy?<br/>
<br/>
Their sabres glitter&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er her little head,<br/>
    Whence her fair hair rose twining with affright,<br/>
Her hidden face was plunged amidst the dead:<br/>
    When Juan caught a glimpse of this sad sight,<br/>
I shall not say exactly what he said,<br/>
    Because it might not solace &lsquo;ears polite;&rsquo;<br/>
But what he did, was to lay on their backs,<br/>
The readiest way of reasoning with Cossacques.<br/>
<br/>
One&rsquo;s hip he slash&rsquo;d, and split the other&rsquo;s shoulder,<br/>
    And drove them with their brutal yells to seek<br/>
If there might be chirurgeons who could solder<br/>
    The wounds they richly merited, and shriek<br/>
Their baffled rage and pain; while waxing colder<br/>
    As he turn&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er each pale and gory cheek,<br/>
Don Juan raised his little captive from<br/>
The heap a moment more had made her tomb.<br/>
<br/>
And she was chill as they, and on her face<br/>
    A slender streak of blood announced how near<br/>
Her fate had been to that of all her race;<br/>
    For the same blow which laid her mother here<br/>
Had scarr&rsquo;d her brow, and left its crimson trace,<br/>
    As the last link with all she had held dear;<br/>
But else unhurt, she open&rsquo;d her large eyes,<br/>
And gazed on Juan with a wild surprise.<br/>
<br/>
Just at this instant, while their eyes were fix&rsquo;d<br/>
    Upon each other, with dilated glance,<br/>
In Juan&rsquo;s look, pain, pleasure, hope, fear, mix&rsquo;d<br/>
    With joy to save, and dread of some mischance<br/>
Unto his protege; while hers, transfix&rsquo;d<br/>
    With infant terrors, glared as from a trance,<br/>
A pure, transparent, pale, yet radiant face,<br/>
Like to a lighted alabaster vase;&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Up came John Johnson (I will not say &lsquo;Jack,&rsquo;<br/>
    For that were vulgar, cold, and commonplace<br/>
On great occasions, such as an attack<br/>
    On cities, as hath been the present case):<br/>
Up Johnson came, with hundreds at his back,<br/>
    Exclaiming;&mdash;&lsquo;Juan! Juan! On, boy! brace<br/>
Your arm, and I&rsquo;ll bet Moscow to a dollar<br/>
That you and I will win St. George&rsquo;s collar.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;The Seraskier is knock&rsquo;d upon the head,<br/>
    But the stone bastion still remains, wherein<br/>
The old Pacha sits among some hundreds dead,<br/>
    Smoking his pipe quite calmly &rsquo;midst the din<br/>
Of our artillery and his own: &rsquo;tis said<br/>
    Our kill&rsquo;d, already piled up to the chin,<br/>
Lie round the battery; but still it batters,<br/>
And grape in volleys, like a vineyard, scatters.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Then up with me!&rsquo;&mdash;But Juan answer&rsquo;d, &lsquo;Look<br/>
    Upon this child&mdash;I saved her&mdash;must not leave<br/>
Her life to chance; but point me out some nook<br/>
    Of safety, where she less may shrink and grieve,<br/>
And I am with you.&rsquo;&mdash;Whereon Johnson took<br/>
    A glance around&mdash;and shrugg&rsquo;d&mdash;and twitch&rsquo;d his sleeve<br/>
And black silk neckcloth&mdash;and replied, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re right;<br/>
Poor thing! what &rsquo;s to be done? I&rsquo;m puzzled quite.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Said Juan: &lsquo;Whatsoever is to be<br/>
    Done, I&rsquo;ll not quit her till she seems secure<br/>
Of present life a good deal more than we.&rsquo;<br/>
    Quoth Johnson: &lsquo;Neither will I quite ensure;<br/>
But at the least you may die gloriously.&rsquo;<br/>
    Juan replied: &lsquo;At least I will endure<br/>
Whate&rsquo;er is to be borne&mdash;but not resign<br/>
This child, who is parentless, and therefore mine.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Johnson said: &lsquo;Juan, we&rsquo;ve no time to lose;<br/>
    The child &rsquo;s a pretty child&mdash;a very pretty&mdash;<br/>
I never saw such eyes&mdash;but hark! now choose<br/>
    Between your fame and feelings, pride and pity;&mdash;<br/>
Hark! how the roar increases!&mdash;no excuse<br/>
    Will serve when there is plunder in a city;&mdash;<br/>
I should be loth to march without you, but,<br/>
By God! we&rsquo;ll be too late for the first cut.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
But Juan was immovable; until<br/>
    Johnson, who really loved him in his way,<br/>
Pick&rsquo;d out amongst his followers with some skill<br/>
    Such as he thought the least given up to prey;<br/>
And swearing if the infant came to ill<br/>
    That they should all be shot on the next day;<br/>
But if she were deliver&rsquo;d safe and sound,<br/>
They should at least have fifty rubles round,<br/>
<br/>
And all allowances besides of plunder<br/>
    In fair proportion with their comrades;&mdash;then<br/>
Juan consented to march on through thunder,<br/>
    Which thinn&rsquo;d at every step their ranks of men:<br/>
And yet the rest rush&rsquo;d eagerly&mdash;no wonder,<br/>
    For they were heated by the hope of gain,<br/>
A thing which happens everywhere each day&mdash;<br/>
No hero trusteth wholly to half pay.<br/>
<br/>
And such is victory, and such is man!<br/>
    At least nine tenths of what we call so;&mdash;God<br/>
May have another name for half we scan<br/>
    As human beings, or his ways are odd.<br/>
But to our subject: a brave Tartar khan&mdash;<br/>
    Or &lsquo;sultan,&rsquo; as the author (to whose nod<br/>
In prose I bend my humble verse) doth call<br/>
This chieftain&mdash;somehow would not yield at all:<br/>
<br/>
But flank&rsquo;d by five brave sons (such is polygamy,<br/>
    That she spawns warriors by the score, where none<br/>
Are prosecuted for that false crime bigamy),<br/>
    He never would believe the city won<br/>
While courage clung but to a single twig.&mdash;Am I<br/>
    Describing Priam&rsquo;s, Peleus&rsquo;, or Jove&rsquo;s son?<br/>
Neither&mdash;but a good, plain, old, temperate man,<br/>
Who fought with his five children in the van.<br/>
<br/>
To take him was the point. The truly brave,<br/>
    When they behold the brave oppress&rsquo;d with odds,<br/>
Are touch&rsquo;d with a desire to shield and save;&mdash;<br/>
    A mixture of wild beasts and demigods<br/>
Are they&mdash;now furious as the sweeping wave,<br/>
    Now moved with pity: even as sometimes nods<br/>
The rugged tree unto the summer wind,<br/>
Compassion breathes along the savage mind.<br/>
<br/>
But he would not be taken, and replied<br/>
    To all the propositions of surrender<br/>
By mowing Christians down on every side,<br/>
    As obstinate as Swedish Charles at Bender.<br/>
His five brave boys no less the foe defied;<br/>
    Whereon the Russian pathos grew less tender,<br/>
As being a virtue, like terrestrial patience,<br/>
Apt to wear out on trifling provocations.<br/>
<br/>
And spite of Johnson and of Juan, who<br/>
    Expended all their Eastern phraseology<br/>
In begging him, for God&rsquo;s sake, just to show<br/>
    So much less fight as might form an apology<br/>
For them in saving such a desperate foe&mdash;<br/>
    He hew&rsquo;d away, like doctors of theology<br/>
When they dispute with sceptics; and with curses<br/>
Struck at his friends, as babies beat their nurses.<br/>
<br/>
Nay, he had wounded, though but slightly, both<br/>
    Juan and Johnson; whereupon they fell,<br/>
The first with sighs, the second with an oath,<br/>
    Upon his angry sultanship, pell-mell,<br/>
And all around were grown exceeding wroth<br/>
    At such a pertinacious infidel,<br/>
And pour&rsquo;d upon him and his sons like rain,<br/>
Which they resisted like a sandy plain<br/>
<br/>
That drinks and still is dry. At last they perish&rsquo;d&mdash;<br/>
    His second son was levell&rsquo;d by a shot;<br/>
His third was sabred; and the fourth, most cherish&rsquo;d<br/>
    Of all the five, on bayonets met his lot;<br/>
The fifth, who, by a Christian mother nourish&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Had been neglected, ill-used, and what not,<br/>
Because deform&rsquo;d, yet died all game and bottom,<br/>
To save a sire who blush&rsquo;d that he begot him.<br/>
<br/>
The eldest was a true and tameless Tartar,<br/>
    As great a scorner of the Nazarene<br/>
As ever Mahomet pick&rsquo;d out for a martyr,<br/>
    Who only saw the black-eyed girls in green,<br/>
Who make the beds of those who won&rsquo;t take quarter<br/>
    On earth, in Paradise; and when once seen,<br/>
Those houris, like all other pretty creatures,<br/>
Do just whate&rsquo;er they please, by dint of features.<br/>
<br/>
And what they pleased to do with the young khan<br/>
    In heaven I know not, nor pretend to guess;<br/>
But doubtless they prefer a fine young man<br/>
    To tough old heroes, and can do no less;<br/>
And that &rsquo;s the cause no doubt why, if we scan<br/>
    A field of battle&rsquo;s ghastly wilderness,<br/>
For one rough, weather-beaten, veteran body,<br/>
You&rsquo;ll find ten thousand handsome coxcombs bloody.<br/>
<br/>
Your houris also have a natural pleasure<br/>
    In lopping off your lately married men,<br/>
Before the bridal hours have danced their measure<br/>
    And the sad, second moon grows dim again,<br/>
Or dull repentance hath had dreary leisure<br/>
    To wish him back a bachelor now and then.<br/>
And thus your houri (it may be) disputes<br/>
Of these brief blossoms the immediate fruits.<br/>
<br/>
Thus the young khan, with houris in his sight,<br/>
    Thought not upon the charms of four young brides,<br/>
But bravely rush&rsquo;d on his first heavenly night.<br/>
    In short, howe&rsquo;er our better faith derides,<br/>
These black-eyed virgins make the Moslems fight,<br/>
    As though there were one heaven and none besides,&mdash;<br/>
Whereas, if all be true we hear of heaven<br/>
And hell, there must at least be six or seven.<br/>
<br/>
So fully flash&rsquo;d the phantom on his eyes,<br/>
    That when the very lance was in his heart,<br/>
He shouted &lsquo;Allah!&rsquo; and saw Paradise<br/>
    With all its veil of mystery drawn apart,<br/>
And bright eternity without disguise<br/>
    On his soul, like a ceaseless sunrise, dart:&mdash;<br/>
With prophets, houris, angels, saints, descried<br/>
In one voluptuous blaze,&mdash;and then he died,<br/>
<br/>
But with a heavenly rapture on his face.<br/>
    The good old khan, who long had ceased to see<br/>
Houris, or aught except his florid race<br/>
    Who grew like cedars round him gloriously&mdash;<br/>
When he beheld his latest hero grace<br/>
    The earth, which he became like a fell&rsquo;d tree,<br/>
Paused for a moment, from the fight, and cast<br/>
A glance on that slain son, his first and last.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers, who beheld him drop his point,<br/>
    Stopp&rsquo;d as if once more willing to concede<br/>
Quarter, in case he bade them not &lsquo;aroynt!&rsquo;<br/>
    As he before had done. He did not heed<br/>
Their pause nor signs: his heart was out of joint,<br/>
    And shook (till now unshaken) like a reed,<br/>
As he look&rsquo;d down upon his children gone,<br/>
And felt&mdash;though done with life&mdash;he was alone<br/>
<br/>
But &rsquo;twas a transient tremor;&mdash;with a spring<br/>
    Upon the Russian steel his breast he flung,<br/>
As carelessly as hurls the moth her wing<br/>
    Against the light wherein she dies: he clung<br/>
Closer, that all the deadlier they might wring,<br/>
    Unto the bayonets which had pierced his young;<br/>
And throwing back a dim look on his sons,<br/>
In one wide wound pour&rsquo;d forth his soul at once.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis strange enough&mdash;the rough, tough soldiers, who<br/>
    Spared neither sex nor age in their career<br/>
Of carnage, when this old man was pierced through,<br/>
    And lay before them with his children near,<br/>
Touch&rsquo;d by the heroism of him they slew,<br/>
    Were melted for a moment: though no tear<br/>
Flow&rsquo;d from their bloodshot eyes, all red with strife,<br/>
They honour&rsquo;d such determined scorn of life.<br/>
<br/>
But the stone bastion still kept up its fire,<br/>
    Where the chief pacha calmly held his post:<br/>
Some twenty times he made the Russ retire,<br/>
    And baffled the assaults of all their host;<br/>
At length he condescended to inquire<br/>
    If yet the city&rsquo;s rest were won or lost;<br/>
And being told the latter, sent a bey<br/>
To answer Ribas&rsquo; summons to give way.<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, cross-legg&rsquo;d, with great sang-froid,<br/>
    Among the scorching ruins he sat smoking<br/>
Tobacco on a little carpet;&mdash;Troy<br/>
    Saw nothing like the scene around:&mdash;yet looking<br/>
With martial stoicism, nought seem&rsquo;d to annoy<br/>
    His stern philosophy; but gently stroking<br/>
His beard, he puff&rsquo;d his pipe&rsquo;s ambrosial gales,<br/>
As if he had three lives, as well as tails.<br/>
<br/>
The town was taken&mdash;whether he might yield<br/>
    Himself or bastion, little matter&rsquo;d now:<br/>
His stubborn valour was no future shield.<br/>
    Ismail &rsquo;s no more! The crescent&rsquo;s silver bow<br/>
Sunk, and the crimson cross glared o&rsquo;er the field,<br/>
    But red with no redeeming gore: the glow<br/>
Of burning streets, like moonlight on the water,<br/>
Was imaged back in blood, the sea of slaughter.<br/>
<br/>
All that the mind would shrink from of excesses;<br/>
    All that the body perpetrates of bad;<br/>
All that we read, hear, dream, of man&rsquo;s distresses;<br/>
    All that the devil would do if run stark mad;<br/>
All that defies the worst which pen expresses;<br/>
    All by which hell is peopled, or as sad<br/>
As hell&mdash;mere mortals who their power abuse&mdash;<br/>
Was here (as heretofore and since) let loose.<br/>
<br/>
If here and there some transient trait of pity<br/>
    Was shown, and some more noble heart broke through<br/>
Its bloody bond, and saved perhaps some pretty<br/>
    Child, or an aged, helpless man or two&mdash;<br/>
What &rsquo;s this in one annihilated city,<br/>
    Where thousand loves, and ties, and duties grew?<br/>
Cockneys of London! Muscadins of Paris!<br/>
Just ponder what a pious pastime war is.<br/>
<br/>
Think how the joys of reading a Gazette<br/>
    Are purchased by all agonies and crimes:<br/>
Or if these do not move you, don&rsquo;t forget<br/>
    Such doom may be your own in aftertimes.<br/>
Meantime the Taxes, Castlereagh, and Debt,<br/>
    Are hints as good as sermons, or as rhymes.<br/>
Read your own hearts and Ireland&rsquo;s present story,<br/>
Then feed her famine fat with Wellesley&rsquo;s glory.<br/>
<br/>
But still there is unto a patriot nation,<br/>
    Which loves so well its country and its king,<br/>
A subject of sublimest exultation&mdash;<br/>
    Bear it, ye Muses, on your brightest wing!<br/>
Howe&rsquo;er the mighty locust, Desolation,<br/>
    Strip your green fields, and to your harvests cling,<br/>
Gaunt famine never shall approach the throne&mdash;<br/>
Though Ireland starve, great George weighs twenty stone.<br/>
<br/>
But let me put an end unto my theme:<br/>
    There was an end of Ismail&mdash;hapless town!<br/>
Far flash&rsquo;d her burning towers o&rsquo;er Danube&rsquo;s stream,<br/>
    And redly ran his blushing waters down.<br/>
The horrid war-whoop and the shriller scream<br/>
    Rose still; but fainter were the thunders grown:<br/>
Of forty thousand who had mann&rsquo;d the wall,<br/>
Some hundreds breathed&mdash;the rest were silent all!<br/>
<br/>
In one thing ne&rsquo;ertheless &rsquo;tis fit to praise<br/>
    The Russian army upon this occasion,<br/>
A virtue much in fashion now-a-days,<br/>
    And therefore worthy of commemoration:<br/>
The topic &rsquo;s tender, so shall be my phrase&mdash;<br/>
    Perhaps the season&rsquo;s chill, and their long station<br/>
In winter&rsquo;s depth, or want of rest and victual,<br/>
Had made them chaste;&mdash;they ravish&rsquo;d very little.<br/>
<br/>
Much did they slay, more plunder, and no less<br/>
    Might here and there occur some violation<br/>
In the other line;&mdash;but not to such excess<br/>
    As when the French, that dissipated nation,<br/>
Take towns by storm: no causes can I guess,<br/>
    Except cold weather and commiseration;<br/>
But all the ladies, save some twenty score,<br/>
Were almost as much virgins as before.<br/>
<br/>
Some odd mistakes, too, happen&rsquo;d in the dark,<br/>
    Which show&rsquo;d a want of lanterns, or of taste&mdash;<br/>
Indeed the smoke was such they scarce could mark<br/>
    Their friends from foes,&mdash;besides such things from haste<br/>
Occur, though rarely, when there is a spark<br/>
    Of light to save the venerably chaste:<br/>
But six old damsels, each of seventy years,<br/>
Were all deflower&rsquo;d by different grenadiers.<br/>
<br/>
But on the whole their continence was great;<br/>
    So that some disappointment there ensued<br/>
To those who had felt the inconvenient state<br/>
    Of &lsquo;single blessedness,&rsquo; and thought it good<br/>
(Since it was not their fault, but only fate,<br/>
    To bear these crosses) for each waning prude<br/>
To make a Roman sort of Sabine wedding,<br/>
Without the expense and the suspense of bedding.<br/>
<br/>
Some voices of the buxom middle-aged<br/>
    Were also heard to wonder in the din<br/>
(Widows of forty were these birds long caged)<br/>
    &lsquo;Wherefore the ravishing did not begin!&rsquo;<br/>
But while the thirst for gore and plunder raged,<br/>
    There was small leisure for superfluous sin;<br/>
But whether they escaped or no, lies hid<br/>
In darkness&mdash;I can only hope they did.<br/>
<br/>
Suwarrow now was conqueror&mdash;a match<br/>
    For Timour or for Zinghis in his trade.<br/>
While mosques and streets, beneath his eyes, like thatch<br/>
    Blazed, and the cannon&rsquo;s roar was scarce allay&rsquo;d,<br/>
With bloody hands he wrote his first despatch;<br/>
    And here exactly follows what he said:&mdash;<br/>
&lsquo;Glory to God and to the Empress!&rsquo; (Powers<br/>
Eternal! such names mingled!) &lsquo;Ismail &rsquo;s ours.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Methinks these are the most tremendous words,<br/>
    Since &lsquo;Mene, Mene, Tekel,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Upharsin,&rsquo;<br/>
Which hands or pens have ever traced of swords.<br/>
    Heaven help me! I&rsquo;m but little of a parson:<br/>
What Daniel read was short-hand of the Lord&rsquo;s,<br/>
    Severe, sublime; the prophet wrote no farce on<br/>
The fate of nations;&mdash;but this Russ so witty<br/>
Could rhyme, like Nero, o&rsquo;er a burning city.<br/>
<br/>
He wrote this Polar melody, and set it,<br/>
    Duly accompanied by shrieks and groans,<br/>
Which few will sing, I trust, but none forget it&mdash;<br/>
    For I will teach, if possible, the stones<br/>
To rise against earth&rsquo;s tyrants. Never let it<br/>
    Be said that we still truckle unto thrones;&mdash;<br/>
But ye&mdash;our children&rsquo;s children! think how we<br/>
Show&rsquo;d what things were before the world was free!<br/>
<br/>
That hour is not for us, but &rsquo;tis for you:<br/>
    And as, in the great joy of your millennium,<br/>
You hardly will believe such things were true<br/>
    As now occur, I thought that I would pen you &rsquo;em;<br/>
But may their very memory perish too!-<br/>
    Yet if perchance remember&rsquo;d, still disdain you &rsquo;em<br/>
More than you scorn the savages of yore,<br/>
Who painted their bare limbs, but not with gore.<br/>
<br/>
And when you hear historians talk of thrones,<br/>
    And those that sate upon them, let it be<br/>
As we now gaze upon the mammoth&rsquo;s bones,<br/>
    &lsquo;And wonder what old world such things could see,<br/>
Or hieroglyphics on Egyptian stones,<br/>
    The pleasant riddles of futurity&mdash;<br/>
Guessing at what shall happily be hid,<br/>
As the real purpose of a pyramid.<br/>
<br/>
Reader! I have kept my word,&mdash;at least so far<br/>
    As the first Canto promised. You have now<br/>
Had sketches of love, tempest, travel, war&mdash;<br/>
    All very accurate, you must allow,<br/>
And epic, if plain truth should prove no bar;<br/>
    For I have drawn much less with a long bow<br/>
Than my forerunners. Carelessly I sing,<br/>
But Phoebus lends me now and then a string,<br/>
<br/>
With which I still can harp, and carp, and fiddle.<br/>
    What farther hath befallen or may befall<br/>
The hero of this grand poetic riddle,<br/>
    I by and by may tell you, if at all:<br/>
But now I choose to break off in the middle,<br/>
    Worn out with battering Ismail&rsquo;s stubborn wall,<br/>
While Juan is sent off with the despatch,<br/>
For which all Petersburgh is on the watch.<br/>
<br/>
This special honour was conferr&rsquo;d, because<br/>
    He had behaved with courage and humanity&mdash;<br/>
Which last men like, when they have time to pause<br/>
    From their ferocities produced by vanity.<br/>
His little captive gain&rsquo;d him some applause<br/>
    For saving her amidst the wild insanity<br/>
Of carnage,&mdash;and I think he was more glad in her<br/>
Safety, than his new order of St. Vladimir.<br/>
<br/>
The Moslem orphan went with her protector,<br/>
    For she was homeless, houseless, helpless; all<br/>
Her friends, like the sad family of Hector,<br/>
    Had perish&rsquo;d in the field or by the wall:<br/>
Her very place of birth was but a spectre<br/>
    Of what it had been; there the Muezzin&rsquo;s cal<br/>
To prayer was heard no more!&mdash;and Juan wept,<br/>
And made a vow to shield her, which he kept.<br/>

CANTO THE NINTH.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
O, Wellington! (or &lsquo;Villainton&rsquo;&mdash;for Fame<br/>
    Sounds the heroic syllables both ways;<br/>
France could not even conquer your great name,<br/>
    But punn&rsquo;d it down to this facetious phrase&mdash;<br/>
Beating or beaten she will laugh the same),<br/>
    You have obtain&rsquo;d great pensions and much praise:<br/>
Glory like yours should any dare gainsay,<br/>
Humanity would rise, and thunder &lsquo;Nay!&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
I don&rsquo;t think that you used Kinnaird quite well<br/>
    In Marinet&rsquo;s affair&mdash;in fact, &rsquo;twas shabby,<br/>
And like some other things won&rsquo;t do to tell<br/>
    Upon your tomb in Westminster&rsquo;s old abbey.<br/>
Upon the rest &rsquo;tis not worth while to dwell,<br/>
    Such tales being for the tea-hours of some tabby;<br/>
But though your years as man tend fast to zero,<br/>
In fact your grace is still but a young hero.<br/>
<br/>
Though Britain owes (and pays you too) so much,<br/>
    Yet Europe doubtless owes you greatly more:<br/>
You have repair&rsquo;d Legitimacy&rsquo;s crutch,<br/>
    A prop not quite so certain as before:<br/>
The Spanish, and the French, as well as Dutch,<br/>
    Have seen, and felt, how strongly you restore;<br/>
And Waterloo has made the world your debtor<br/>
(I wish your bards would sing it rather better).<br/>
<br/>
You are &lsquo;the best of cut-throats:&rsquo;&mdash;do not start;<br/>
    The phrase is Shakspeare&rsquo;s, and not misapplied:<br/>
War &rsquo;s a brain-spattering, windpipe-slitting art,<br/>
    Unless her cause by right be sanctified.<br/>
If you have acted once a generous part,<br/>
    The world, not the world&rsquo;s masters, will decide,<br/>
And I shall be delighted to learn who,<br/>
Save you and yours, have gain&rsquo;d by Waterloo?<br/>
<br/>
I am no flatterer&mdash;you&rsquo;ve supp&rsquo;d full of flattery:<br/>
    They say you like it too&mdash;&rsquo;tis no great wonder.<br/>
He whose whole life has been assault and battery,<br/>
    At last may get a little tired of thunder;<br/>
And swallowing eulogy much more than satire, he<br/>
    May like being praised for every lucky blunder,<br/>
Call&rsquo;d &lsquo;Saviour of the Nations&rsquo;&mdash;not yet saved,<br/>
And &lsquo;Europe&rsquo;s Liberator&rsquo;&mdash;still enslaved.<br/>
<br/>
I&rsquo;ve done. Now go and dine from off the plate<br/>
    Presented by the Prince of the Brazils,<br/>
And send the sentinel before your gate<br/>
    A slice or two from your luxurious meals:<br/>
He fought, but has not fed so well of late.<br/>
    Some hunger, too, they say the people feels:&mdash;<br/>
There is no doubt that you deserve your ration,<br/>
But pray give back a little to the nation.<br/>
<br/>
I don&rsquo;t mean to reflect&mdash;a man so great as<br/>
    You, my lord duke! is far above reflection:<br/>
The high Roman fashion, too, of Cincinnatus,<br/>
    With modern history has but small connection:<br/>
Though as an Irishman you love potatoes,<br/>
    You need not take them under your direction;<br/>
And half a million for your Sabine farm<br/>
Is rather dear!&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I mean no harm.<br/>
<br/>
Great men have always scorn&rsquo;d great recompenses:<br/>
    Epaminondas saved his Thebes, and died,<br/>
Not leaving even his funeral expenses:<br/>
    George Washington had thanks and nought beside,<br/>
Except the all-cloudless glory which few men&rsquo;s is<br/>
    To free his country: Pitt too had his pride,<br/>
And as a high-soul&rsquo;d minister of state is<br/>
Renown&rsquo;d for ruining Great Britain gratis.<br/>
<br/>
Never had mortal man such opportunity,<br/>
    Except Napoleon, or abused it more:<br/>
You might have freed fallen Europe from the unity<br/>
    Of tyrants, and been blest from shore to shore:<br/>
And now&mdash;what is your fame? Shall the Muse tune it ye?<br/>
    Now&mdash;that the rabble&rsquo;s first vain shouts are o&rsquo;er?<br/>
Go! hear it in your famish&rsquo;d country&rsquo;s cries!<br/>
Behold the world! and curse your victories!<br/>
<br/>
As these new cantos touch on warlike feats,<br/>
    To you the unflattering Muse deigns to inscribe<br/>
Truths, that you will not read in the Gazettes,<br/>
    But which &rsquo;tis time to teach the hireling tribe<br/>
Who fatten on their country&rsquo;s gore, and debts,<br/>
    Must be recited, and&mdash;without a bribe.<br/>
You did great things; but not being great in mind,<br/>
Have left undone the greatest&mdash;and mankind.<br/>
<br/>
Death laughs&mdash;Go ponder o&rsquo;er the skeleton<br/>
    With which men image out the unknown thing<br/>
That hides the past world, like to a set sun<br/>
    Which still elsewhere may rouse a brighter spring&mdash;<br/>
Death laughs at all you weep for:&mdash;look upon<br/>
    This hourly dread of all! whose threaten&rsquo;d sting<br/>
Turns life to terror, even though in its sheath:<br/>
Mark how its lipless mouth grins without breath!<br/>
<br/>
Mark how it laughs and scorns at all you are!<br/>
    And yet was what you are: from ear to ear<br/>
It laughs not&mdash;there is now no fleshy bar<br/>
    So call&rsquo;d; the Antic long hath ceased to hear,<br/>
But still he smiles; and whether near or far,<br/>
    He strips from man that mantle (far more dear<br/>
Than even the tailor&rsquo;s), his incarnate skin,<br/>
White, black, or copper&mdash;the dead bones will grin.<br/>
<br/>
And thus Death laughs,&mdash;it is sad merriment,<br/>
    But still it is so; and with such example<br/>
Why should not Life be equally content<br/>
    With his superior, in a smile to trample<br/>
Upon the nothings which are daily spent<br/>
    Like bubbles on an ocean much less ample<br/>
Than the eternal deluge, which devours<br/>
Suns as rays&mdash;worlds like atoms&mdash;years like hours?<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;To be, or not to be? that is the question,&rsquo;<br/>
    Says Shakspeare, who just now is much in fashion.<br/>
I am neither Alexander nor Hephaestion,<br/>
    Nor ever had for abstract fame much passion;<br/>
But would much rather have a sound digestion<br/>
    Than Buonaparte&rsquo;s cancer: could I dash on<br/>
Through fifty victories to shame or fame&mdash;<br/>
Without a stomach what were a good name?<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;O dura ilia messorum!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oh<br/>
    Ye rigid guts of reapers!&rsquo; I translate<br/>
For the great benefit of those who know<br/>
    What indigestion is&mdash;that inward fate<br/>
Which makes all Styx through one small liver flow.<br/>
    A peasant&rsquo;s sweat is worth his lord&rsquo;s estate:<br/>
Let this one toil for bread&mdash;that rack for rent,<br/>
He who sleeps best may be the most content.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;To be, or not to be?&rsquo;&mdash;Ere I decide,<br/>
    I should be glad to know that which is being?<br/>
&rsquo;Tis true we speculate both far and wide,<br/>
    And deem, because we see, we are all-seeing:<br/>
For my part, I&rsquo;ll enlist on neither side,<br/>
    Until I see both sides for once agreeing.<br/>
For me, I sometimes think that life is death,<br/>
Rather than life a mere affair of breath.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Que scais-je?&rsquo; was the motto of Montaigne,<br/>
    As also of the first academicians:<br/>
That all is dubious which man may attain,<br/>
    Was one of their most favourite positions.<br/>
There&rsquo;s no such thing as certainty, that &rsquo;s plain<br/>
    As any of Mortality&rsquo;s conditions;<br/>
So little do we know what we&rsquo;re about in<br/>
This world, I doubt if doubt itself be doubting.<br/>
<br/>
It is a pleasant voyage perhaps to float,<br/>
    Like Pyrrho, on a sea of speculation;<br/>
But what if carrying sail capsize the boat?<br/>
    Your wise men don&rsquo;t know much of navigation;<br/>
And swimming long in the abyss of thought<br/>
    Is apt to tire: a calm and shallow station<br/>
Well nigh the shore, where one stoops down and gathers<br/>
Some pretty shell, is best for moderate bathers.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;But heaven,&rsquo; as Cassio says, &lsquo;is above all&mdash;<br/>
    No more of this, then,&mdash;let us pray!&rsquo; We have<br/>
Souls to save, since Eve&rsquo;s slip and Adam&rsquo;s fall,<br/>
    Which tumbled all mankind into the grave,<br/>
Besides fish, beasts, and birds. &lsquo;The sparrow&rsquo;s fall<br/>
    Is special providence,&rsquo; though how it gave<br/>
Offence, we know not; probably it perch&rsquo;d<br/>
Upon the tree which Eve so fondly search&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
O, ye immortal gods! what is theogony?<br/>
    O, thou too, mortal man! what is philanthropy?<br/>
O, world! which was and is, what is cosmogony?<br/>
    Some people have accused me of misanthropy;<br/>
And yet I know no more than the mahogany<br/>
    That forms this desk, of what they mean; lykanthropy<br/>
I comprehend, for without transformation<br/>
Men become wolves on any slight occasion.<br/>
<br/>
But I, the mildest, meekest of mankind,<br/>
    Like Moses, or Melancthon, who have ne&rsquo;er<br/>
Done anything exceedingly unkind,&mdash;<br/>
    And (though I could not now and then forbear<br/>
Following the bent of body or of mind)<br/>
    Have always had a tendency to spare,&mdash;<br/>
Why do they call me misanthrope? Because<br/>
They hate me, not I them.&mdash;and here we&rsquo;ll pause.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis time we should proceed with our good poem,&mdash;<br/>
    For I maintain that it is really good,<br/>
Not only in the body but the proem,<br/>
    However little both are understood<br/>
Just now,&mdash;but by and by the Truth will show &rsquo;em<br/>
    Herself in her sublimest attitude:<br/>
And till she doth, I fain must be content<br/>
To share her beauty and her banishment.<br/>
<br/>
Our hero (and, I trust, kind reader, yours)<br/>
    Was left upon his way to the chief city<br/>
Of the immortal Peter&rsquo;s polish&rsquo;d boors<br/>
    Who still have shown themselves more brave than witty.<br/>
I know its mighty empire now allures<br/>
    Much flattery&mdash;even Voltaire&rsquo;s, and that &rsquo;s a pity.<br/>
For me, I deem an absolute autocrat<br/>
Not a barbarian, but much worse than that.<br/>
<br/>
And I will war, at least in words (and&mdash;should<br/>
    My chance so happen&mdash;deeds), with all who war<br/>
With Thought;&mdash;and of Thought&rsquo;s foes by far most rude,<br/>
    Tyrants and sycophants have been and are.<br/>
I know not who may conquer: if I could<br/>
    Have such a prescience, it should be no bar<br/>
To this my plain, sworn, downright detestation<br/>
Of every depotism in every nation.<br/>
<br/>
It is not that I adulate the people:<br/>
    Without me, there are demagogues enough,<br/>
And infidels, to pull down every steeple,<br/>
    And set up in their stead some proper stuff.<br/>
Whether they may sow scepticism to reap hell,<br/>
    As is the Christian dogma rather rough,<br/>
I do not know;&mdash;I wish men to be free<br/>
As much from mobs as kings&mdash;from you as me.<br/>
<br/>
The consequence is, being of no party,<br/>
    I shall offend all parties: never mind!<br/>
My words, at least, are more sincere and hearty<br/>
    Than if I sought to sail before the wind.<br/>
He who has nought to gain can have small art: he<br/>
    Who neither wishes to be bound nor bind,<br/>
May still expatiate freely, as will I,<br/>
Nor give my voice to slavery&rsquo;s jackal cry.<br/>
<br/>
That &rsquo;s an appropriate simile, that jackal;&mdash;<br/>
    I&rsquo;ve heard them in the Ephesian ruins howl<br/>
By night, as do that mercenary pack all,<br/>
    Power&rsquo;s base purveyors, who for pickings prowl,<br/>
And scent the prey their masters would attack all.<br/>
    However, the poor jackals are less foul<br/>
(As being the brave lions&rsquo; keen providers)<br/>
Than human insects, catering for spiders.<br/>
<br/>
Raise but an arm! &rsquo;twill brush their web away,<br/>
    And without that, their poison and their claws<br/>
Are useless. Mind, good people! what I say<br/>
    (Or rather peoples)&mdash;go on without pause!<br/>
The web of these tarantulas each day<br/>
    Increases, till you shall make common cause:<br/>
None, save the Spanish fly and Attic bee,<br/>
As yet are strongly stinging to be free.<br/>
<br/>
Don Juan, who had shone in the late slaughter,<br/>
    Was left upon his way with the despatch,<br/>
Where blood was talk&rsquo;d of as we would of water;<br/>
    And carcasses that lay as thick as thatch<br/>
O&rsquo;er silenced cities, merely served to flatter<br/>
    Fair Catherine&rsquo;s pastime&mdash;who look&rsquo;d on the match<br/>
Between these nations as a main of cocks,<br/>
Wherein she liked her own to stand like rocks.<br/>
<br/>
And there in a kibitka he roll&rsquo;d on<br/>
    (A cursed sort of carriage without springs,<br/>
Which on rough roads leaves scarcely a whole bone),<br/>
    Pondering on glory, chivalry, and kings,<br/>
And orders, and on all that he had done&mdash;<br/>
    And wishing that post-horses had the wings<br/>
Of Pegasus, or at the least post-chaises<br/>
Had feathers, when a traveller on deep ways is.<br/>
<br/>
At every jolt&mdash;and they were many&mdash;still<br/>
    He turn&rsquo;d his eyes upon his little charge,<br/>
As if he wish&rsquo;d that she should fare less ill<br/>
    Than he, in these sad highways left at large<br/>
To ruts, and flints, and lovely Nature&rsquo;s skill,<br/>
    Who is no paviour, nor admits a barge<br/>
On her canals, where God takes sea and land,<br/>
Fishery and farm, both into his own hand.<br/>
<br/>
At least he pays no rent, and has best right<br/>
    To be the first of what we used to call<br/>
&lsquo;Gentlemen farmer&rsquo;&mdash;a race worn out quite,<br/>
    Since lately there have been no rents at all,<br/>
And &lsquo;gentlemen&rsquo; are in a piteous plight,<br/>
    And &lsquo;farmers&rsquo; can&rsquo;t raise Ceres from her fall:<br/>
She fell with Buonaparte&mdash;What strange thoughts<br/>
Arise, when we see emperors fall with oats!<br/>
<br/>
But Juan turn&rsquo;d his eyes on the sweet child<br/>
    Whom he had saved from slaughter&mdash;what a trophy<br/>
O! ye who build up monuments, defiled<br/>
    With gore, like Nadir Shah, that costive sophy,<br/>
Who, after leaving Hindostan a wild,<br/>
    And scarce to the Mogul a cup of coffee<br/>
To soothe his woes withal, was slain, the sinner!<br/>
Because he could no more digest his dinner;&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
O ye! or we! or he! or she! reflect,<br/>
    That one life saved, especially if young<br/>
Or pretty, is a thing to recollect<br/>
    Far sweeter than the greenest laurels sprung<br/>
From the manure of human clay, though deck&rsquo;d<br/>
    With all the praises ever said or sung:<br/>
Though hymn&rsquo;d by every harp, unless within<br/>
Your heart joins chorus, Fame is but a din.<br/>
<br/>
O! ye great authors luminous, voluminous!<br/>
    Ye twice ten hundred thousand daily scribes!<br/>
Whose pamphlets, volumes, newspapers, illumine us!<br/>
    Whether you&rsquo;re paid by government in bribes,<br/>
To prove the public debt is not consuming us&mdash;<br/>
    Or, roughly treading on the &lsquo;courtier&rsquo;s kibes&rsquo;<br/>
With clownish heel, your popular circulation<br/>
Feeds you by printing half the realm&rsquo;s starvation;&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
O, ye great authors!&mdash;&lsquo;Apropos des bottes,&rsquo;-<br/>
    I have forgotten what I meant to say,<br/>
As sometimes have been greater sages&rsquo; lots;<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas something calculated to allay<br/>
All wrath in barracks, palaces, or cots:<br/>
    Certes it would have been but thrown away,<br/>
And that &rsquo;s one comfort for my lost advice,<br/>
Although no doubt it was beyond all price.<br/>
<br/>
But let it go:&mdash;it will one day be found<br/>
    With other relics of &lsquo;a former world,&rsquo;<br/>
When this world shall be former, underground,<br/>
    Thrown topsy-turvy, twisted, crisp&rsquo;d, and curl&rsquo;d,<br/>
Baked, fried, or burnt, turn&rsquo;d inside-out, or drown&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Like all the worlds before, which have been hurl&rsquo;d<br/>
First out of, and then back again to chaos,<br/>
The superstratum which will overlay us.<br/>
<br/>
So Cuvier says;&mdash;and then shall come again<br/>
    Unto the new creation, rising out<br/>
From our old crash, some mystic, ancient strain<br/>
    Of things destroy&rsquo;d and left in airy doubt:<br/>
Like to the notions we now entertain<br/>
    Of Titans, giants, fellows of about<br/>
Some hundred feet in height, not to say miles,<br/>
And mammoths, and your winged crocodiles.<br/>
<br/>
Think if then George the Fourth should be dug up!<br/>
    How the new worldlings of the then new East<br/>
Will wonder where such animals could sup!<br/>
    (For they themselves will be but of the least:<br/>
Even worlds miscarry, when too oft they pup,<br/>
    And every new creation hath decreased<br/>
In size, from overworking the material&mdash;<br/>
Men are but maggots of some huge Earth&rsquo;s burial.)<br/>
<br/>
How will&mdash;to these young people, just thrust out<br/>
    From some fresh Paradise, and set to plough,<br/>
And dig, and sweat, and turn themselves about,<br/>
    And plant, and reap, and spin, and grind, and sow,<br/>
Till all the arts at length are brought about,<br/>
    Especially of war and taxing,&mdash;how,<br/>
I say, will these great relics, when they see &rsquo;em,<br/>
Look like the monsters of a new museum?<br/>
<br/>
But I am apt to grow too metaphysical:<br/>
    &lsquo;The time is out of joint,&rsquo;&mdash;and so am I;<br/>
I quite forget this poem &rsquo;s merely quizzical,<br/>
    And deviate into matters rather dry.<br/>
I ne&rsquo;er decide what I shall say, and this I cal<br/>
    Much too poetical: men should know why<br/>
They write, and for what end; but, note or text,<br/>
I never know the word which will come next.<br/>
<br/>
So on I ramble, now and then narrating,<br/>
    Now pondering:&mdash;it is time we should narrate.<br/>
I left Don Juan with his horses baiting&mdash;<br/>
    Now we&rsquo;ll get o&rsquo;er the ground at a great rate.<br/>
I shall not be particular in stating<br/>
    His journey, we&rsquo;ve so many tours of late:<br/>
Suppose him then at Petersburgh; suppose<br/>
That pleasant capital of painted snows;<br/>
<br/>
Suppose him in a handsome uniform,&mdash;<br/>
    A scarlet coat, black facings, a long plume,<br/>
Waving, like sails new shiver&rsquo;d in a storm,<br/>
    Over a cock&rsquo;d hat in a crowded room,<br/>
And brilliant breeches, bright as a Cairn Gorme,<br/>
    Of yellow casimere we may presume,<br/>
White stocking drawn uncurdled as new milk<br/>
O&rsquo;er limbs whose symmetry set off the silk;<br/>
<br/>
Suppose him sword by side, and hat in hand,<br/>
    Made up by youth, fame, and an army tailor&mdash;<br/>
That great enchanter, at whose rod&rsquo;s command<br/>
    Beauty springs forth, and Nature&rsquo;s self turns paler,<br/>
Seeing how Art can make her work more grand<br/>
    (When she don&rsquo;t pin men&rsquo;s limbs in like a gaoler),&mdash;<br/>
Behold him placed as if upon a pillar! He<br/>
Seems Love turn&rsquo;d a lieutenant of artillery:&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
His bandage slipp&rsquo;d down into a cravat;<br/>
    His wings subdued to epaulettes; his quiver<br/>
Shrunk to a scabbard, with his arrows at<br/>
    His side as a small sword, but sharp as ever;<br/>
His bow converted into a cock&rsquo;d hat;<br/>
    But still so like, that Psyche were more clever<br/>
Than some wives (who make blunders no less stupid),<br/>
If she had not mistaken him for Cupid.<br/>
<br/>
The courtiers stared, the ladies whisper&rsquo;d, and<br/>
    The empress smiled: the reigning favourite frown&rsquo;d&mdash;<br/>
I quite forget which of them was in hand<br/>
    Just then; as they are rather numerous found,<br/>
Who took by turns that difficult command<br/>
    Since first her majesty was singly crown&rsquo;d:<br/>
But they were mostly nervous six-foot fellows,<br/>
All fit to make a Patagonian jealous.<br/>
<br/>
Juan was none of these, but slight and slim,<br/>
    Blushing and beardless; and yet ne&rsquo;ertheless<br/>
There was a something in his turn of limb,<br/>
    And still more in his eye, which seem&rsquo;d to express,<br/>
That though he look&rsquo;d one of the seraphim,<br/>
    There lurk&rsquo;d a man beneath the spirit&rsquo;s dress.<br/>
Besides, the empress sometimes liked a boy,<br/>
And had just buried the fair-faced Lanskoi.<br/>
<br/>
No wonder then that Yermoloff, or Momonoff,<br/>
    Or Scherbatoff, or any other off<br/>
Or on, might dread her majesty had not room enough<br/>
    Within her bosom (which was not too tough)<br/>
For a new flame; a thought to cast of gloom enough<br/>
    Along the aspect, whether smooth or rough,<br/>
Of him who, in the language of his station,<br/>
Then held that &lsquo;high official situation.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
O, gentle ladies! should you seek to know<br/>
    The import of this diplomatic phrase,<br/>
Bid Ireland&rsquo;s Londonderry&rsquo;s Marquess show<br/>
    His parts of speech; and in the strange displays<br/>
Of that odd string of words, all in a row,<br/>
    Which none divine, and every one obeys,<br/>
Perhaps you may pick out some queer no meaning,<br/>
Of that weak wordy harvest the sole gleaning.<br/>
<br/>
I think I can explain myself without<br/>
    That sad inexplicable beast of prey&mdash;<br/>
That Sphinx, whose words would ever be a doubt,<br/>
    Did not his deeds unriddle them each day&mdash;<br/>
That monstrous hieroglyphic&mdash;that long spout<br/>
    Of blood and water, leaden Castlereagh!<br/>
And here I must an anecdote relate,<br/>
But luckily of no great length or weight.<br/>
<br/>
An English lady ask&rsquo;d of an Italian,<br/>
    What were the actual and official duties<br/>
Of the strange thing some women set a value on,<br/>
    Which hovers oft about some married beauties,<br/>
Called &lsquo;Cavalier servente?&rsquo;&mdash;a Pygmalion<br/>
    Whose statues warm (I fear, alas! too true &rsquo;tis)<br/>
Beneath his art. The dame, press&rsquo;d to disclose them,<br/>
Said&mdash;&lsquo;Lady, I beseech you to suppose them.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
And thus I supplicate your supposition,<br/>
    And mildest, matron-like interpretation,<br/>
Of the imperial favourite&rsquo;s condition.<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas a high place, the highest in the nation<br/>
In fact, if not in rank; and the suspicion<br/>
    Of any one&rsquo;s attaining to his station,<br/>
No doubt gave pain, where each new pair of shoulders,<br/>
If rather broad, made stocks rise and their holders.<br/>
<br/>
Juan, I said, was a most beauteous boy,<br/>
    And had retain&rsquo;d his boyish look beyond<br/>
The usual hirsute seasons which destroy,<br/>
    With beards and whiskers, and the like, the fond<br/>
Parisian aspect which upset old Troy<br/>
    And founded Doctors&rsquo; Commons:&mdash;I have conn&rsquo;d<br/>
The history of divorces, which, though chequer&rsquo;d,<br/>
Calls Ilion&rsquo;s the first damages on record.<br/>
<br/>
And Catherine, who loved all things (save her lord,<br/>
    Who was gone to his place), and pass&rsquo;d for much<br/>
Admiring those (by dainty dames abhorr&rsquo;d)<br/>
    Gigantic gentlemen, yet had a touch<br/>
Of sentiment; and he she most adored<br/>
    Was the lamented Lanskoi, who was such<br/>
A lover as had cost her many a tear,<br/>
And yet but made a middling grenadier.<br/>
<br/>
O thou &lsquo;teterrima causa&rsquo; of all &lsquo;belli&rsquo;-<br/>
    Thou gate of life and death&mdash;thou nondescript!<br/>
Whence is our exit and our entrance,&mdash;well I<br/>
    May pause in pondering how all souls are dipt<br/>
In thy perennial fountain:&mdash;how man fell I<br/>
    Know not, since knowledge saw her branches stript<br/>
Of her first fruit; but how he falls and rises<br/>
Since, thou hast settled beyond all surmises.<br/>
<br/>
Some call thee &lsquo;the worst cause of war,&rsquo; but I<br/>
    Maintain thou art the best: for after all<br/>
From thee we come, to thee we go, and why<br/>
    To get at thee not batter down a wall,<br/>
Or waste a world? since no one can deny<br/>
    Thou dost replenish worlds both great and small:<br/>
With, or without thee, all things at a stand<br/>
Are, or would be, thou sea of life&rsquo;s dry land!<br/>
<br/>
Catherine, who was the grand epitome<br/>
    Of that great cause of war, or peace, or what<br/>
You please (it causes all the things which be,<br/>
    So you may take your choice of this or that)&mdash;<br/>
Catherine, I say, was very glad to see<br/>
    The handsome herald, on whose plumage sat<br/>
Victory; and pausing as she saw him kneel<br/>
With his despatch, forgot to break the seal.<br/>
<br/>
Then recollecting the whole empress, nor<br/>
    forgetting quite the woman (which composed<br/>
At least three parts of this great whole), she tore<br/>
    The letter open with an air which posed<br/>
The court, that watch&rsquo;d each look her visage wore,<br/>
    Until a royal smile at length disclosed<br/>
Fair weather for the day. Though rather spacious,<br/>
Her face was noble, her eyes fine, mouth gracious.<br/>
<br/>
Great joy was hers, or rather joys: the first<br/>
    Was a ta&rsquo;en city, thirty thousand slain.<br/>
Glory and triumph o&rsquo;er her aspect burst,<br/>
    As an East Indian sunrise on the main.<br/>
These quench&rsquo;d a moment her ambition&rsquo;s thirst&mdash;<br/>
    So Arab deserts drink in summer&rsquo;s rain:<br/>
In vain!&mdash;As fall the dews on quenchless sands,<br/>
Blood only serves to wash Ambition&rsquo;s hands!<br/>
<br/>
Her next amusement was more fanciful;<br/>
    She smiled at mad Suwarrow&rsquo;s rhymes, who threw<br/>
Into a Russian couplet rather dull<br/>
    The whole gazette of thousands whom he slew.<br/>
Her third was feminine enough to annul<br/>
    The shudder which runs naturally through<br/>
Our veins, when things call&rsquo;d sovereigns think it best<br/>
To kill, and generals turn it into jest.<br/>
<br/>
The two first feelings ran their course complete,<br/>
    And lighted first her eye, and then her mouth:<br/>
The whole court look&rsquo;d immediately most sweet,<br/>
    Like flowers well water&rsquo;d after a long drouth.<br/>
But when on the lieutenant at her feet<br/>
    Her majesty, who liked to gaze on youth<br/>
Almost as much as on a new despatch,<br/>
Glanced mildly, all the world was on the watch.<br/>
<br/>
Though somewhat large, exuberant, and truculent,<br/>
    When wroth&mdash;while pleased, she was as fine a figure<br/>
As those who like things rosy, ripe, and succulent,<br/>
    Would wish to look on, while they are in vigour.<br/>
She could repay each amatory look you lent<br/>
    With interest, and in turn was wont with rigour<br/>
To exact of Cupid&rsquo;s bills the full amount<br/>
At sight, nor would permit you to discount.<br/>
<br/>
With her the latter, though at times convenient,<br/>
    Was not so necessary; for they tell<br/>
That she was handsome, and though fierce look&rsquo;d lenient,<br/>
    And always used her favourites too well.<br/>
If once beyond her boudoir&rsquo;s precincts in ye went,<br/>
    Your &lsquo;fortune&rsquo; was in a fair way &lsquo;to swell<br/>
A man&rsquo; (as Giles says); for though she would widow all<br/>
Nations, she liked man as an individual.<br/>
<br/>
What a strange thing is man? and what a stranger<br/>
    Is woman! What a whirlwind is her head,<br/>
And what a whirlpool full of depth and danger<br/>
    Is all the rest about her! Whether wed<br/>
Or widow, maid or mother, she can change her<br/>
    Mind like the wind: whatever she has said<br/>
Or done, is light to what she&rsquo;ll say or do;&mdash;<br/>
The oldest thing on record, and yet new!<br/>
<br/>
O Catherine! (for of all interjections,<br/>
    To thee both oh! and ah! belong of right<br/>
In love and war) how odd are the connections<br/>
    Of human thoughts, which jostle in their flight!<br/>
Just now yours were cut out in different sections:<br/>
    First Ismail&rsquo;s capture caught your fancy quite;<br/>
Next of new knights, the fresh and glorious batch;<br/>
And thirdly he who brought you the despatch!<br/>
<br/>
Shakspeare talks of &lsquo;the herald Mercury<br/>
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;&rsquo;<br/>
And some such visions cross&rsquo;d her majesty,<br/>
    While her young herald knelt before her still.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis very true the hill seem&rsquo;d rather high,<br/>
    For a lieutenant to climb up; but skill<br/>
Smooth&rsquo;d even the Simplon&rsquo;s steep, and by God&rsquo;s blessing<br/>
With youth and health all kisses are &lsquo;heaven-kissing.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Her majesty look&rsquo;d down, the youth look&rsquo;d up&mdash;<br/>
    And so they fell in love;&mdash;she with his face,<br/>
His grace, his God-knows-what: for Cupid&rsquo;s cup<br/>
    With the first draught intoxicates apace,<br/>
A quintessential laudanum or &lsquo;black drop,&rsquo;<br/>
    Which makes one drunk at once, without the base<br/>
Expedient of full bumpers; for the eye<br/>
In love drinks all life&rsquo;s fountains (save tears) dry.<br/>
<br/>
He, on the other hand, if not in love,<br/>
    Fell into that no less imperious passion,<br/>
Self-love&mdash;which, when some sort of thing above<br/>
    Ourselves, a singer, dancer, much in fashion,<br/>
Or duchess, princess, empress, &lsquo;deigns to prove&rsquo;<br/>
    (&rsquo;Tis Pope&rsquo;s phrase) a great longing, though a rash one,<br/>
For one especial person out of many,<br/>
Makes us believe ourselves as good as any.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, he was of that delighted age<br/>
    Which makes all female ages equal&mdash;when<br/>
We don&rsquo;t much care with whom we may engage,<br/>
    As bold as Daniel in the lion&rsquo;s den,<br/>
So that we can our native sun assuage<br/>
    In the next ocean, which may flow just then,<br/>
To make a twilight in, just as Sol&rsquo;s heat is<br/>
Quench&rsquo;d in the lap of the salt sea, or Thetis.<br/>
<br/>
And Catherine (we must say thus much for Catherine),<br/>
    Though bold and bloody, was the kind of thing<br/>
Whose temporary passion was quite flattering,<br/>
    Because each lover look&rsquo;d a sort of king,<br/>
Made up upon an amatory pattern,<br/>
    A royal husband in all save the ring&mdash;<br/>
Which, being the damn&rsquo;dest part of matrimony,<br/>
Seem&rsquo;d taking out the sting to leave the honey.<br/>
<br/>
And when you add to this, her womanhood<br/>
    In its meridian, her blue eyes or gray<br/>
(The last, if they have soul, are quite as good,<br/>
    Or better, as the best examples say:<br/>
Napoleon&rsquo;s, Mary&rsquo;s (queen of Scotland), should<br/>
    Lend to that colour a transcendent ray;<br/>
And Pallas also sanctions the same hue,<br/>
Too wise to look through optics black or blue)&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Her sweet smile, and her then majestic figure,<br/>
    Her plumpness, her imperial condescension,<br/>
Her preference of a boy to men much bigger<br/>
    (Fellows whom Messalina&rsquo;s self would pension),<br/>
Her prime of life, just now in juicy vigour,<br/>
    With other extras, which we need not mention,&mdash;<br/>
All these, or any one of these, explain<br/>
Enough to make a stripling very vain.<br/>
<br/>
And that &rsquo;s enough, for love is vanity,<br/>
    Selfish in its beginning as its end,<br/>
Except where &rsquo;tis a mere insanity,<br/>
    A maddening spirit which would strive to blend<br/>
Itself with beauty&rsquo;s frail inanity,<br/>
    On which the passion&rsquo;s self seems to depend:<br/>
And hence some heathenish philosophers<br/>
Make love the main spring of the universe.<br/>
<br/>
Besides Platonic love, besides the love<br/>
    Of God, the love of sentiment, the loving<br/>
Of faithful pairs (I needs must rhyme with dove,<br/>
    That good old steam-boat which keeps verses moving<br/>
&rsquo;Gainst reason&mdash;Reason ne&rsquo;er was hand-and-glove<br/>
    With rhyme, but always leant less to improving<br/>
The sound than sense)&mdash;beside all these pretences<br/>
To love, there are those things which words name senses;<br/>
<br/>
Those movements, those improvements in our bodies<br/>
    Which make all bodies anxious to get out<br/>
Of their own sand-pits, to mix with a goddess,<br/>
    For such all women are at first no doubt.<br/>
How beautiful that moment! and how odd is<br/>
    That fever which precedes the languid rout<br/>
Of our sensations! What a curious way<br/>
The whole thing is of clothing souls in clay!<br/>
<br/>
The noblest kind of love is love Platonical,<br/>
    To end or to begin with; the next grand<br/>
Is that which may be christen&rsquo;d love canonical,<br/>
    Because the clergy take the thing in hand;<br/>
The third sort to be noted in our chronicle<br/>
    As flourishing in every Christian land,<br/>
Is when chaste matrons to their other ties<br/>
Add what may be call&rsquo;d marriage in disguise.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we won&rsquo;t analyse&mdash;our story must<br/>
    Tell for itself: the sovereign was smitten,<br/>
Juan much flatter&rsquo;d by her love, or lust;&mdash;<br/>
    I cannot stop to alter words once written,<br/>
And the two are so mix&rsquo;d with human dust,<br/>
    That he who names one, both perchance may hit on:<br/>
But in such matters Russia&rsquo;s mighty empress<br/>
Behaved no better than a common sempstress.<br/>
<br/>
The whole court melted into one wide whisper,<br/>
    And all lips were applied unto all ears!<br/>
The elder ladies&rsquo; wrinkles curl&rsquo;d much crisper<br/>
    As they beheld; the younger cast some leers<br/>
On one another, and each lovely lisper<br/>
    Smiled as she talk&rsquo;d the matter o&rsquo;er; but tears<br/>
Of rivalship rose in each clouded eye<br/>
Of all the standing army who stood by.<br/>
<br/>
All the ambassadors of all the powers<br/>
    Enquired, Who was this very new young man,<br/>
Who promised to be great in some few hours?<br/>
    Which is full soon&mdash;though life is but a span.<br/>
Already they beheld the silver showers<br/>
    Of rubles rain, as fast as specie can,<br/>
Upon his cabinet, besides the presents<br/>
Of several ribands, and some thousand peasants.<br/>
<br/>
Catherine was generous,&mdash;all such ladies are:<br/>
    Love, that great opener of the heart and all<br/>
The ways that lead there, be they near or far,<br/>
    Above, below, by turnpikes great or small,&mdash;<br/>
Love (though she had a cursed taste for war,<br/>
    And was not the best wife, unless we call<br/>
Such Clytemnestra, though perhaps &rsquo;tis better<br/>
That one should die, than two drag on the fetter)&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Love had made Catherine make each lover&rsquo;s fortune,<br/>
    Unlike our own half-chaste Elizabeth,<br/>
Whose avarice all disbursements did importune,<br/>
    If history, the grand liar, ever saith<br/>
The truth; and though grief her old age might shorten,<br/>
    Because she put a favourite to death,<br/>
Her vile, ambiguous method of flirtation,<br/>
And stinginess, disgrace her sex and station.<br/>
<br/>
But when the levee rose, and all was bustle<br/>
    In the dissolving circle, all the nations&rsquo;<br/>
Ambassadors began as &rsquo;twere to hustle<br/>
    Round the young man with their congratulations.<br/>
Also the softer silks were heard to rustle<br/>
    Of gentle dames, among whose recreations<br/>
It is to speculate on handsome faces,<br/>
Especially when such lead to high places.<br/>
<br/>
Juan, who found himself, he knew not how,<br/>
    A general object of attention, made<br/>
His answers with a very graceful bow,<br/>
    As if born for the ministerial trade.<br/>
Though modest, on his unembarrass&rsquo;d brow<br/>
    Nature had written &lsquo;gentleman.&rsquo; He said<br/>
Little, but to the purpose; and his manner<br/>
Flung hovering graces o&rsquo;er him like a banner.<br/>
<br/>
An order from her majesty consign&rsquo;d<br/>
    Our young lieutenant to the genial care<br/>
Of those in office: all the world look&rsquo;d kind<br/>
    (As it will look sometimes with the first stare,<br/>
Which youth would not act ill to keep in mind),<br/>
    As also did Miss Protasoff then there,<br/>
Named from her mystic office&rsquo;l&rsquo;Eprouveuse,&rsquo;<br/>
A term inexplicable to the Muse.<br/>
<br/>
With her then, as in humble duty bound,<br/>
    Juan retired,&mdash;and so will I, until<br/>
My Pegasus shall tire of touching ground.<br/>
    We have just lit on a &lsquo;heaven-kissing hill,&rsquo;<br/>
So lofty that I feel my brain turn round,<br/>
    And all my fancies whirling like a mill;<br/>
Which is a signal to my nerves and brain,<br/>
To take a quiet ride in some green Lane.<br/>

CANTO THE TENTH.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
When Newton saw an apple fall, he found<br/>
    In that slight startle from his contemplation&mdash;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis said (for I&rsquo;ll not answer above ground<br/>
    For any sage&rsquo;s creed or calculation)&mdash;<br/>
A mode of proving that the earth turn&rsquo;d round<br/>
    In a most natural whirl, called &lsquo;gravitation;&rsquo;<br/>
And this is the sole mortal who could grapple,<br/>
Since Adam, with a fall or with an apple.<br/>
<br/>
Man fell with apples, and with apples rose,<br/>
    If this be true; for we must deem the mode<br/>
In which Sir Isaac Newton could disclose<br/>
    Through the then unpaved stars the turnpike road,<br/>
A thing to counterbalance human woes:<br/>
    For ever since immortal man hath glow&rsquo;d<br/>
With all kinds of mechanics, and full soon<br/>
Steam-engines will conduct him to the moon.<br/>
<br/>
And wherefore this exordium?&mdash;Why, just now,<br/>
    In taking up this paltry sheet of paper,<br/>
My bosom underwent a glorious glow,<br/>
    And my internal spirit cut a caper:<br/>
And though so much inferior, as I know,<br/>
    To those who, by the dint of glass and vapour,<br/>
Discover stars and sail in the wind&rsquo;s eye,<br/>
I wish to do as much by poesy.<br/>
<br/>
In the wind&rsquo;s eye I have sail&rsquo;d, and sail; but for<br/>
    The stars, I own my telescope is dim:<br/>
But at least I have shunn&rsquo;d the common shore,<br/>
    And leaving land far out of sight, would skim<br/>
The ocean of eternity: the roar<br/>
    Of breakers has not daunted my slight, trim,<br/>
But still sea-worthy skiff; and she may float<br/>
Where ships have founder&rsquo;d, as doth many a boat.<br/>
<br/>
We left our hero, Juan, in the bloom<br/>
    Of favouritism, but not yet in the blush;<br/>
And far be it from my Muses to presume<br/>
    (For I have more than one Muse at a push)<br/>
To follow him beyond the drawing-room:<br/>
    It is enough that Fortune found him flush<br/>
Of youth, and vigour, beauty, and those things<br/>
Which for an instant clip enjoyment&rsquo;s wings.<br/>
<br/>
But soon they grow again and leave their nest.<br/>
    &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; saith the Psalmist, &lsquo;that I had a dove&rsquo;s<br/>
Pinions to flee away, and be at rest!&rsquo;<br/>
    And who that recollects young years and loves,&mdash;<br/>
Though hoary now, and with a withering breast,<br/>
    And palsied fancy, which no longer roves<br/>
Beyond its dimm&rsquo;d eye&rsquo;s sphere,&mdash;but would much rather<br/>
Sigh like his son, than cough like his grandfather?<br/>
<br/>
But sighs subside, and tears (even widows&rsquo;) shrink,<br/>
    Like Arno in the summer, to a shallow,<br/>
So narrow as to shame their wintry brink,<br/>
    Which threatens inundations deep and yellow!<br/>
Such difference doth a few months make. You&rsquo;d think<br/>
    Grief a rich field which never would lie fallow;<br/>
No more it doth, its ploughs but change their boys,<br/>
Who furrow some new soil to sow for joys.<br/>
<br/>
But coughs will come when sighs depart&mdash;and now<br/>
    And then before sighs cease; for oft the one<br/>
Will bring the other, ere the lake-like brow<br/>
    Is ruffled by a wrinkle, or the sun<br/>
Of life reach&rsquo;d ten o&rsquo;clock: and while a glow,<br/>
    Hectic and brief as summer&rsquo;s day nigh done,<br/>
O&rsquo;erspreads the cheek which seems too pure for clay,<br/>
Thousands blaze, love, hope, die,&mdash;how happy they!<br/>
<br/>
But Juan was not meant to die so soon.<br/>
    We left him in the focus of such glory<br/>
As may be won by favour of the moon<br/>
    Or ladies&rsquo; fancies&mdash;rather transitory<br/>
Perhaps; but who would scorn the month of June,<br/>
    Because December, with his breath so hoary,<br/>
Must come? Much rather should he court the ray,<br/>
To hoard up warmth against a wintry day.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, he had some qualities which fix<br/>
    Middle-aged ladies even more than young:<br/>
The former know what &rsquo;s what; while new-fledged chicks<br/>
    Know little more of love than what is sung<br/>
In rhymes, or dreamt (for fancy will play tricks)<br/>
    In visions of those skies from whence Love sprung.<br/>
Some reckon women by their suns or years,<br/>
I rather think the moon should date the dears.<br/>
<br/>
And why? because she &rsquo;s changeable and chaste.<br/>
    I know no other reason, whatsoe&rsquo;er<br/>
Suspicious people, who find fault in haste,<br/>
    May choose to tax me with; which is not fair,<br/>
Nor flattering to &lsquo;their temper or their taste,&rsquo;<br/>
    As my friend Jeffrey writes with such an air:<br/>
However, I forgive him, and I trust<br/>
He will forgive himself;&mdash;if not, I must.<br/>
<br/>
Old enemies who have become new friends<br/>
    Should so continue&mdash;&rsquo;tis a point of honour;<br/>
And I know nothing which could make amends<br/>
    For a return to hatred: I would shun her<br/>
Like garlic, howsoever she extends<br/>
    Her hundred arms and legs, and fain outrun her.<br/>
Old flames, new wives, become our bitterest foes&mdash;<br/>
Converted foes should scorn to join with those.<br/>
<br/>
This were the worst desertion:&mdash;renegadoes,<br/>
    Even shuffling Southey, that incarnate lie,<br/>
Would scarcely join again the &lsquo;reformadoes,&rsquo;<br/>
    Whom he forsook to fill the laureate&rsquo;s sty:<br/>
And honest men from Iceland to Barbadoes,<br/>
    Whether in Caledon or Italy,<br/>
Should not veer round with every breath, nor seize<br/>
To pain, the moment when you cease to please.<br/>
<br/>
The lawyer and the critic but behold<br/>
    The baser sides of literature and life,<br/>
And nought remains unseen, but much untold,<br/>
    By those who scour those double vales of strife.<br/>
While common men grow ignorantly old,<br/>
    The lawyer&rsquo;s brief is like the surgeon&rsquo;s knife,<br/>
Dissecting the whole inside of a question,<br/>
And with it all the process of digestion.<br/>
<br/>
A legal broom &rsquo;s a moral chimney-sweeper,<br/>
    And that &rsquo;s the reason he himself &rsquo;s so dirty;<br/>
The endless soot bestows a tint far deeper<br/>
    Than can be hid by altering his shirt; he<br/>
Retains the sable stains of the dark creeper,<br/>
    At least some twenty-nine do out of thirty,<br/>
In all their habits;&mdash;not so you, I own;<br/>
As Caesar wore his robe you wear your gown.<br/>
<br/>
And all our little feuds, at least all mine,<br/>
    Dear Jefferson, once my most redoubted foe<br/>
(As far as rhyme and criticism combine<br/>
    To make such puppets of us things below),<br/>
Are over: Here &rsquo;s a health to &lsquo;Auld Lang Syne!&rsquo;<br/>
    I do not know you, and may never know<br/>
Your face&mdash;but you have acted on the whole<br/>
Most nobly, and I own it from my soul.<br/>
<br/>
And when I use the phrase of &lsquo;Auld Lang Syne!&rsquo;<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis not address&rsquo;d to you&mdash;the more &rsquo;s the pity<br/>
For me, for I would rather take my wine<br/>
    With you, than aught (save Scott) in your proud city.<br/>
But somehow,&mdash;it may seem a schoolboy&rsquo;s whine,<br/>
    And yet I seek not to be grand nor witty,<br/>
But I am half a Scot by birth, and bred<br/>
A whole one, and my heart flies to my head,&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
As &lsquo;Auld Lang Syne&rsquo; brings Scotland, one and all,<br/>
    Scotch plaids, Scotch snoods, the blue hills, and clear streams,<br/>
The Dee, the Don, Balgounie&rsquo;s brig&rsquo;s black wall,<br/>
    All my boy feelings, all my gentler dreams<br/>
Of what I then dreamt, clothed in their own pall,<br/>
    Like Banquo&rsquo;s offspring;&mdash;floating past me seems<br/>
My childhood in this childishness of mine:<br/>
I care not&mdash;&rsquo;tis a glimpse of &lsquo;Auld Lang Syne.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
And though, as you remember, in a fit<br/>
    Of wrath and rhyme, when juvenile and curly,<br/>
I rail&rsquo;d at Scots to show my wrath and wit,<br/>
    Which must be own&rsquo;d was sensitive and surly,<br/>
Yet &rsquo;tis in vain such sallies to permit,<br/>
    They cannot quench young feelings fresh and early:<br/>
I &lsquo;scotch&rsquo;d not kill&rsquo;d&rsquo; the Scotchman in my blood,<br/>
And love the land of &lsquo;mountain and of flood.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Don Juan, who was real, or ideal,&mdash;<br/>
    For both are much the same, since what men think<br/>
Exists when the once thinkers are less real<br/>
    Than what they thought, for mind can never sink,<br/>
And &rsquo;gainst the body makes a strong appeal;<br/>
    And yet &rsquo;tis very puzzling on the brink<br/>
Of what is call&rsquo;d eternity, to stare,<br/>
And know no more of what is here, than there;&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Don Juan grew a very polish&rsquo;d Russian&mdash;<br/>
    How we won&rsquo;t mention, why we need not say:<br/>
Few youthful minds can stand the strong concussion<br/>
    Of any slight temptation in their way;<br/>
But his just now were spread as is a cushion<br/>
    Smooth&rsquo;d for a monarch&rsquo;s seat of honour; gay<br/>
Damsels, and dances, revels, ready money,<br/>
Made ice seem paradise, and winter sunny.<br/>
<br/>
The favour of the empress was agreeable;<br/>
    And though the duty wax&rsquo;d a little hard,<br/>
Young people at his time of life should be able<br/>
    To come off handsomely in that regard.<br/>
He was now growing up like a green tree, able<br/>
    For love, war, or ambition, which reward<br/>
Their luckier votaries, till old age&rsquo;s tedium<br/>
Make some prefer the circulating medium.<br/>
<br/>
About this time, as might have been anticipated,<br/>
    Seduced by youth and dangerous examples,<br/>
Don Juan grew, I fear, a little dissipated;<br/>
    Which is a sad thing, and not only tramples<br/>
On our fresh feelings, but&mdash;as being participated<br/>
    With all kinds of incorrigible samples<br/>
Of frail humanity&mdash;must make us selfish,<br/>
And shut our souls up in us like a shell-fish.<br/>
<br/>
This we pass over. We will also pass<br/>
    The usual progress of intrigues between<br/>
Unequal matches, such as are, alas!<br/>
    A young lieutenant&rsquo;s with a not old queen,<br/>
But one who is not so youthful as she was<br/>
    In all the royalty of sweet seventeen.<br/>
Sovereigns may sway materials, but not matter,<br/>
<br/>
And Death, the sovereign&rsquo;s sovereign, though the great<br/>
    Gracchus of all mortality, who levels<br/>
With his Agrarian laws the high estate<br/>
    Of him who feasts, and fights, and roars, and revels,<br/>
To one small grass-grown patch (which must await<br/>
    Corruption for its crop) with the poor devils<br/>
Who never had a foot of land till now,&mdash;<br/>
Death &rsquo;s a reformer, all men must allow.<br/>
<br/>
He lived (not Death, but Juan) in a hurry<br/>
    Of waste, and haste, and glare, and gloss, and glitter,<br/>
In this gay clime of bear-skins black and furry&mdash;<br/>
    Which (though I hate to say a thing that &rsquo;s bitter)<br/>
Peep out sometimes, when things are in a flurry,<br/>
    Through all the &lsquo;purple and fine linen,&rsquo; fitter<br/>
For Babylon&rsquo;s than Russia&rsquo;s royal harlot&mdash;<br/>
And neutralize her outward show of scarlet.<br/>
<br/>
And this same state we won&rsquo;t describe: we would<br/>
    Perhaps from hearsay, or from recollection;<br/>
But getting nigh grim Dante&rsquo;s &lsquo;obscure wood,&rsquo;<br/>
    That horrid equinox, that hateful section<br/>
Of human years, that half-way house, that rude<br/>
    Hut, whence wise travellers drive with circumspection<br/>
Life&rsquo;s sad post-horses o&rsquo;er the dreary frontier<br/>
Of age, and looking back to youth, give one tear;&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
I won&rsquo;t describe,&mdash;that is, if I can help<br/>
    Description; and I won&rsquo;t reflect,&mdash;that is,<br/>
If I can stave off thought, which&mdash;as a whelp<br/>
    Clings to its teat&mdash;sticks to me through the abyss<br/>
Of this odd labyrinth; or as the kelp<br/>
    Holds by the rock; or as a lover&rsquo;s kiss<br/>
Drains its first draught of lips:&mdash;but, as I said,<br/>
I won&rsquo;t philosophise, and will be read.<br/>
<br/>
Juan, instead of courting courts, was courted,&mdash;<br/>
    A thing which happens rarely: this he owed<br/>
Much to his youth, and much to his reported<br/>
    Valour; much also to the blood he show&rsquo;d,<br/>
Like a race-horse; much to each dress he sported,<br/>
    Which set the beauty off in which he glow&rsquo;d,<br/>
As purple clouds befringe the sun; but most<br/>
He owed to an old woman and his post.<br/>
<br/>
He wrote to Spain:&mdash;and all his near relations,<br/>
    Perceiving fie was in a handsome way<br/>
Of getting on himself, and finding stations<br/>
    For cousins also, answer&rsquo;d the same day.<br/>
Several prepared themselves for emigrations;<br/>
    And eating ices, were o&rsquo;erheard to say,<br/>
That with the addition of a slight pelisse,<br/>
Madrid&rsquo;s and Moscow&rsquo;s climes were of a piece.<br/>
<br/>
His mother, Donna Inez, finding, too,<br/>
    That in the lieu of drawing on his banker,<br/>
Where his assets were waxing rather few,<br/>
    He had brought his spending to a handsome anchor,&mdash;<br/>
Replied, &lsquo;that she was glad to see him through<br/>
    Those pleasures after which wild youth will hanker;<br/>
As the sole sign of man&rsquo;s being in his senses<br/>
Is, learning to reduce his past expenses.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;She also recommended him to God,<br/>
    And no less to God&rsquo;s Son, as well as Mother,<br/>
Warn&rsquo;d him against Greek worship, which looks odd<br/>
    In Catholic eyes; but told him, too, to smother<br/>
Outward dislike, which don&rsquo;t look well abroad;<br/>
    Inform&rsquo;d him that he had a little brother<br/>
Born in a second wedlock; and above<br/>
All, praised the empress&rsquo;s maternal love.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;She could not too much give her approbation<br/>
    Unto an empress, who preferr&rsquo;d young men<br/>
Whose age, and what was better still, whose nation<br/>
    And climate, stopp&rsquo;d all scandal (now and then):&mdash;<br/>
At home it might have given her some vexation;<br/>
    But where thermometers sunk down to ten,<br/>
Or five, or one, or zero, she could never<br/>
Believe that virtue thaw&rsquo;d before the river.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
O for a forty-parson power to chant<br/>
    Thy praise, Hypocrisy! Oh for a hymn<br/>
Loud as the virtues thou dost loudly vaunt,<br/>
    Not practise! Oh for trumps of cherubim!<br/>
Or the ear-trumpet of my good old aunt,<br/>
    Who, though her spectacles at last grew dim,<br/>
Drew quiet consolation through its hint,<br/>
When she no more could read the pious print.<br/>
<br/>
She was no hypocrite at least, poor soul,<br/>
    But went to heaven in as sincere a way<br/>
As any body on the elected roll,<br/>
    Which portions out upon the judgment day<br/>
Heaven&rsquo;s freeholds, in a sort of doomsday scroll,<br/>
    Such as the conqueror William did repay<br/>
His knights with, lotting others&rsquo; properties<br/>
Into some sixty thousand new knights&rsquo; fees.<br/>
<br/>
I can&rsquo;t complain, whose ancestors are there,<br/>
    Erneis, Radulphus&mdash;eight-and-forty manors<br/>
(If that my memory doth not greatly err)<br/>
    Were their reward for following Billy&rsquo;s banners:<br/>
And though I can&rsquo;t help thinking &rsquo;twas scarce fair<br/>
    To strip the Saxons of their hydes, like tanners;<br/>
Yet as they founded churches with the produce,<br/>
You&rsquo;ll deem, no doubt, they put it to a good use.<br/>
<br/>
The gentle Juan flourish&rsquo;d, though at times<br/>
    He felt like other plants called sensitive,<br/>
Which shrink from touch, as monarchs do from rhymes,<br/>
    Save such as Southey can afford to give.<br/>
Perhaps he long&rsquo;d in bitter frosts for climes<br/>
    In which the Neva&rsquo;s ice would cease to live<br/>
Before May-day: perhaps, despite his duty,<br/>
In royalty&rsquo;s vast arms he sigh d for beauty:<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps&mdash;but, sans perhaps, we need not seek<br/>
    For causes young or old: the canker-worm<br/>
Will feed upon the fairest, freshest cheek,<br/>
    As well as further drain the wither&rsquo;d form:<br/>
Care, like a housekeeper, brings every week<br/>
    His bills in, and however we may storm,<br/>
They must be paid: though six days smoothly run,<br/>
The seventh will bring blue devils or a dun.<br/>
<br/>
I don&rsquo;t know how it was, but he grew sick:<br/>
    The empress was alarm&rsquo;d, and her physician<br/>
(The same who physick&rsquo;d Peter) found the tick<br/>
    Of his fierce pulse betoken a condition<br/>
Which augur&rsquo;d of the dead, however quick<br/>
    Itself, and show&rsquo;d a feverish disposition;<br/>
At which the whole court was extremely troubled,<br/>
The sovereign shock&rsquo;d, and all his medicines doubled.<br/>
<br/>
Low were the whispers, manifold the rumours:<br/>
    Some said he had been poison&rsquo;d by Potemkin;<br/>
Others talk&rsquo;d learnedly of certain tumours,<br/>
    Exhaustion, or disorders of the same kin;<br/>
Some said &rsquo;twas a concoction of the humours,<br/>
    Which with the blood too readily will claim kin;<br/>
Others again were ready to maintain,<br/>
&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas only the fatigue of last campaign.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
But here is one prescription out of many:<br/>
    &lsquo;Sodae sulphat. 3vj. 3fs. Mannae optim.<br/>
Aq. fervent. f. 3ifs. 3ij. tinct. Sennae<br/>
    Haustus&rsquo; (And here the surgeon came and cupp&rsquo;d him)<br/>
&lsquo;Rx Pulv Com gr. iij. Ipecacuanhae&rsquo;<br/>
    (With more beside if Juan had not stopp&rsquo;d &rsquo;em).<br/>
&lsquo;Bolus Potassae Sulphuret. sumendus,<br/>
Et haustus ter in die capiendus.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
This is the way physicians mend or end us,<br/>
    Secundum artem: but although we sneer<br/>
In health&mdash;when ill, we call them to attend us,<br/>
    Without the least propensity to jeer:<br/>
While that &lsquo;hiatus maxime deflendus&rsquo;<br/>
    To be fill&rsquo;d up by spade or mattock&rsquo;s near,<br/>
Instead of gliding graciously down Lethe,<br/>
We tease mild Baillie, or soft Abernethy.<br/>
<br/>
Juan demurr&rsquo;d at this first notice to<br/>
    Quit; and though death had threaten&rsquo;d an ejection,<br/>
His youth and constitution bore him through,<br/>
    And sent the doctors in a new direction.<br/>
But still his state was delicate: the hue<br/>
    Of health but flicker&rsquo;d with a faint reflection<br/>
Along his wasted cheek, and seem&rsquo;d to gravel<br/>
The faculty&mdash;who said that he must travel.<br/>
<br/>
The climate was too cold, they said, for him,<br/>
    Meridian-born, to bloom in. This opinion<br/>
Made the chaste Catherine look a little grim,<br/>
    Who did not like at first to lose her minion:<br/>
But when she saw his dazzling eye wax dim,<br/>
    And drooping like an eagle&rsquo;s with clipt pinion,<br/>
She then resolved to send him on a mission,<br/>
But in a style becoming his condition.<br/>
<br/>
There was just then a kind of a discussion,<br/>
    A sort of treaty or negotiation<br/>
Between the British cabinet and Russian,<br/>
    Maintain&rsquo;d with all the due prevarication<br/>
With which great states such things are apt to push on;<br/>
    Something about the Baltic&rsquo;s navigation,<br/>
Hides, train-oil, tallow, and the rights of Thetis,<br/>
Which Britons deem their &lsquo;uti possidetis.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
So Catherine, who had a handsome way<br/>
    Of fitting out her favourites, conferr&rsquo;d<br/>
This secret charge on Juan, to display<br/>
    At once her royal splendour, and reward<br/>
His services. He kiss&rsquo;d hands the next day,<br/>
    Received instructions how to play his card,<br/>
Was laden with all kinds of gifts and honours,<br/>
Which show&rsquo;d what great discernment was the donor&rsquo;s.<br/>
<br/>
But she was lucky, and luck &rsquo;s all. Your queens<br/>
    Are generally prosperous in reigning;<br/>
Which puzzles us to know what Fortune means.<br/>
    But to continue: though her years were waning<br/>
Her climacteric teased her like her teens;<br/>
    And though her dignity brook&rsquo;d no complaining,<br/>
So much did Juan&rsquo;s setting off distress her,<br/>
She could not find at first a fit successor.<br/>
<br/>
But time, the comforter, will come at last;<br/>
    And four-and-twenty hours, and twice that number<br/>
Of candidates requesting to be placed,<br/>
    Made Catherine taste next night a quiet slumber:&mdash;<br/>
Not that she meant to fix again in haste,<br/>
    Nor did she find the quantity encumber,<br/>
But always choosing with deliberation,<br/>
Kept the place open for their emulation.<br/>
<br/>
While this high post of honour &rsquo;s in abeyance,<br/>
    For one or two days, reader, we request<br/>
You&rsquo;ll mount with our young hero the conveyance<br/>
    Which wafted him from Petersburgh: the best<br/>
Barouche, which had the glory to display once<br/>
    The fair czarina&rsquo;s autocratic crest,<br/>
When, a new lphigene, she went to Tauris,<br/>
Was given to her favourite, and now bore his.<br/>
<br/>
A bull-dog, and a bullfinch, and an ermine,<br/>
    All private favourites of Don Juan;&mdash;for<br/>
(Let deeper sages the true cause determine)<br/>
    He had a kind of inclination, or<br/>
Weakness, for what most people deem mere vermin,<br/>
    Live animals: an old maid of threescore<br/>
For cats and birds more penchant ne&rsquo;er display&rsquo;d,<br/>
Although he was not old, nor even a maid;&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
The animals aforesaid occupied<br/>
    Their station: there were valets, secretaries,<br/>
In other vehicles; but at his side<br/>
    Sat little Leila, who survived the parries<br/>
He made &rsquo;gainst Cossacque sabres, in the wide<br/>
    Slaughter of Ismail. Though my wild Muse varies<br/>
Her note, she don&rsquo;t forget the infant girl<br/>
Whom he preserved, a pure and living pearl<br/>
<br/>
Poor little thing! She was as fair as docile,<br/>
    And with that gentle, serious character,<br/>
As rare in living beings as a fossile<br/>
    Man, &rsquo;midst thy mouldy mammoths, &lsquo;grand Cuvier!&rsquo;<br/>
Ill fitted was her ignorance to jostle<br/>
    With this o&rsquo;erwhelming world, where all must err:<br/>
But she was yet but ten years old, and therefore<br/>
Was tranquil, though she knew not why or wherefore.<br/>
<br/>
Don Juan loved her, and she loved him, as<br/>
    Nor brother, father, sister, daughter love.<br/>
I cannot tell exactly what it was;<br/>
    He was not yet quite old enough to prove<br/>
Parental feelings, and the other class,<br/>
    Call&rsquo;d brotherly affection, could not move<br/>
His bosom,&mdash;for he never had a sister:<br/>
Ah! if he had, how much he would have miss&rsquo;d her!<br/>
<br/>
And still less was it sensual; for besides<br/>
    That he was not an ancient debauchee<br/>
(Who like sour fruit, to stir their veins&rsquo; salt tides,<br/>
    As acids rouse a dormant alkali),<br/>
Although (&rsquo;twill happen as our planet guides)<br/>
    His youth was not the chastest that might be,<br/>
There was the purest Platonism at bottom<br/>
Of all his feelings&mdash;only he forgot &rsquo;em.<br/>
<br/>
Just now there was no peril of temptation;<br/>
    He loved the infant orphan he had saved,<br/>
As patriots (now and then) may love a nation;<br/>
    His pride, too, felt that she was not enslaved<br/>
Owing to him;&mdash;as also her salvation<br/>
    Through his means and the church&rsquo;s might be paved.<br/>
But one thing &rsquo;s odd, which here must be inserted,<br/>
The little Turk refused to be converted.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Twas strange enough she should retain the impression<br/>
    Through such a scene of change, and dread, and slaughter;<br/>
But though three bishops told her the transgression,<br/>
    She show&rsquo;d a great dislike to holy water:<br/>
She also had no passion for confession;<br/>
    Perhaps she had nothing to confess:&mdash;no matter,<br/>
Whate&rsquo;er the cause, the church made little of it&mdash;<br/>
She still held out that Mahomet was a prophet.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the only Christian she could bear<br/>
    Was Juan; whom she seem&rsquo;d to have selected<br/>
In place of what her home and friends once were.<br/>
    He naturally loved what he protected:<br/>
And thus they form&rsquo;d a rather curious pair,<br/>
    A guardian green in years, a ward connected<br/>
In neither clime, time, blood, with her defender;<br/>
And yet this want of ties made theirs more tender.<br/>
<br/>
They journey&rsquo;d on through Poland and through Warsaw,<br/>
    Famous for mines of salt and yokes of iron:<br/>
Through Courland also, which that famous farce saw<br/>
    Which gave her dukes the graceless name of &lsquo;Biron.&rsquo;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis the same landscape which the modern Mars saw,<br/>
    Who march&rsquo;d to Moscow, led by Fame, the siren!<br/>
To lose by one month&rsquo;s frost some twenty years<br/>
Of conquest, and his guard of grenadiers.<br/>
<br/>
Let this not seem an anti-climax:&mdash;&lsquo;Oh!<br/>
    My guard! my old guard exclaim&rsquo;d!&rsquo; exclaim&rsquo;d that god of day.<br/>
Think of the Thunderer&rsquo;s falling down below<br/>
    Carotid-artery-cutting Castlereagh!<br/>
Alas, that glory should be chill&rsquo;d by snow!<br/>
    But should we wish to warm us on our way<br/>
Through Poland, there is Kosciusko&rsquo;s name<br/>
Might scatter fire through ice, like Hecla&rsquo;s flame.<br/>
<br/>
From Poland they came on through Prussia Proper,<br/>
    And Konigsberg the capital, whose vaunt,<br/>
Besides some veins of iron, lead, or copper,<br/>
    Has lately been the great Professor Kant.<br/>
Juan, who cared not a tobacco-stopper<br/>
    About philosophy, pursued his jaunt<br/>
To Germany, whose somewhat tardy millions<br/>
Have princes who spur more than their postilions.<br/>
<br/>
And thence through Berlin, Dresden, and the like,<br/>
    Until he reach&rsquo;d the castellated Rhine:&mdash;<br/>
Ye glorious Gothic scenes! how much ye strike<br/>
    All phantasies, not even excepting mine;<br/>
A grey wall, a green ruin, rusty pike,<br/>
    Make my soul pass the equinoctial line<br/>
Between the present and past worlds, and hover<br/>
Upon their airy confine, half-seas-over.<br/>
<br/>
But Juan posted on through Manheim, Bonn,<br/>
    Which Drachenfels frowns over like a spectre<br/>
Of the good feudal times forever gone,<br/>
    On which I have not time just now to lecture.<br/>
From thence he was drawn onwards to Cologne,<br/>
    A city which presents to the inspector<br/>
Eleven thousand maidenheads of bone,<br/>
The greatest number flesh hath ever known.<br/>
<br/>
From thence to Holland&rsquo;s Hague and Helvoetsluys,<br/>
    That water-land of Dutchmen and of ditches,<br/>
Where juniper expresses its best juice,<br/>
    The poor man&rsquo;s sparkling substitute for riches.<br/>
Senates and sages have condemn&rsquo;d its use&mdash;<br/>
    But to deny the mob a cordial, which is<br/>
Too often all the clothing, meat, or fuel,<br/>
Good government has left them, seems but cruel.<br/>
<br/>
Here he embark&rsquo;d, and with a flowing sail<br/>
    Went bounding for the island of the free,<br/>
Towards which the impatient wind blew half a gale;<br/>
    High dash&rsquo;d the spray, the bows dipp&rsquo;d in the sea,<br/>
And sea-sick passengers turn&rsquo;d somewhat pale;<br/>
    But Juan, season&rsquo;d, as he well might be,<br/>
By former voyages, stood to watch the skiffs<br/>
Which pass&rsquo;d, or catch the first glimpse of the cliffs.<br/>
<br/>
At length they rose, like a white wall along<br/>
    The blue sea&rsquo;s border; and I Don Juan felt&mdash;<br/>
What even young strangers feel a little strong<br/>
    At the first sight of Albion&rsquo;s chalky belt&mdash;<br/>
A kind of pride that he should be among<br/>
    Those haughty shopkeepers, who sternly dealt<br/>
Their goods and edicts out from pole to pole,<br/>
And made the very billows pay them toll.<br/>
<br/>
I&rsquo;ve no great cause to love that spot of earth,<br/>
    Which holds what might have been the noblest nation;<br/>
But though I owe it little but my birth,<br/>
    I feel a mix&rsquo;d regret and veneration<br/>
For its decaying fame and former worth.<br/>
    Seven years (the usual term of transportation)<br/>
Of absence lay one&rsquo;s old resentments level,<br/>
When a man&rsquo;s country &rsquo;s going to the devil.<br/>
<br/>
Alas! could she but fully, truly, know<br/>
    How her great name is now throughout abhorr&rsquo;d:<br/>
How eager all the earth is for the blow<br/>
    Which shall lay bare her bosom to the sword;<br/>
How all the nations deem her their worst foe,<br/>
    That worse than worst of foes, the once adored<br/>
False friend, who held out freedom to mankind,<br/>
And now would chain them, to the very mind:&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Would she be proud, or boast herself the free,<br/>
    Who is but first of slaves? The nations are<br/>
In prison,&mdash;but the gaoler, what is he?<br/>
    No less a victim to the bolt and bar.<br/>
Is the poor privilege to turn the key<br/>
    Upon the captive, freedom? He &rsquo;s as far<br/>
From the enjoyment of the earth and air<br/>
Who watches o&rsquo;er the chain, as they who wear.<br/>
<br/>
Don Juan now saw Albion&rsquo;s earliest beauties,<br/>
    Thy cliffs, dear Dover! harbour, and hotel;<br/>
Thy custom-house, with all its delicate duties;<br/>
    Thy waiters running mucks at every bell;<br/>
Thy packets, all whose passengers are booties<br/>
    To those who upon land or water dwell;<br/>
And last, not least, to strangers uninstructed,<br/>
Thy long, long bills, whence nothing is deducted.<br/>
<br/>
Juan, though careless, young, and magnifique,<br/>
    And rich in rubles, diamonds, cash, and credit,<br/>
Who did not limit much his bills per week,<br/>
    Yet stared at this a little, though he paid it<br/>
(His Maggior Duomo, a smart, subtle Greek,<br/>
    Before him summ&rsquo;d the awful scroll and read it);<br/>
But doubtless as the air, though seldom sunny,<br/>
Is free, the respiration&rsquo;s worth the money.<br/>
<br/>
On with the horses! Off to Canterbury!<br/>
    Tramp, tramp o&rsquo;er pebble, and splash, splash through puddle;<br/>
Hurrah! how swiftly speeds the post so merry!<br/>
    Not like slow Germany, wherein they muddle<br/>
Along the road, as if they went to bury<br/>
    Their fare; and also pause besides, to fuddle<br/>
With &lsquo;schnapps&rsquo;&mdash;sad dogs! whom &lsquo;Hundsfot,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Verflucter,&rsquo;<br/>
Affect no more than lightning a conductor.<br/>
<br/>
Now there is nothing gives a man such spirits,<br/>
    Leavening his blood as cayenne doth a curry,<br/>
As going at full speed&mdash;no matter where its<br/>
    Direction be, so &rsquo;tis but in a hurry,<br/>
And merely for the sake of its own merits;<br/>
    For the less cause there is for all this flurry,<br/>
The greater is the pleasure in arriving<br/>
At the great end of travel&mdash;which is driving.<br/>
<br/>
They saw at Canterbury the cathedral;<br/>
    Black Edward&rsquo;s helm, and Becket&rsquo;s bloody stone,<br/>
Were pointed out as usual by the bedral,<br/>
    In the same quaint, uninterested tone:&mdash;<br/>
There&rsquo;s glory again for you, gentle reader! All<br/>
    Ends in a rusty casque and dubious bone,<br/>
Half-solved into these sodas or magnesias;<br/>
Which form that bitter draught, the human species.<br/>
<br/>
The effect on Juan was of course sublime:<br/>
    He breathed a thousand Cressys, as he saw<br/>
That casque, which never stoop&rsquo;d except to Time.<br/>
    Even the bold Churchman&rsquo;s tomb excited awe,<br/>
Who died in the then great attempt to climb<br/>
    O&rsquo;er kings, who now at least must talk of law<br/>
Before they butcher. Little Leila gazed,<br/>
And ask&rsquo;d why such a structure had been raised:<br/>
<br/>
And being told it was &lsquo;God&rsquo;s house,&rsquo; she said<br/>
    He was well lodged, but only wonder&rsquo;d how<br/>
He suffer&rsquo;d Infidels in his homestead,<br/>
    The cruel Nazarenes, who had laid low<br/>
His holy temples in the lands which bred<br/>
    The True Believers:&mdash;and her infant brow<br/>
Was bent with grief that Mahomet should resign<br/>
A mosque so noble, flung like pearls to swine.<br/>
<br/>
O! oh! through meadows managed like a garden,<br/>
    A paradise of hops and high production;<br/>
For after years of travel by a bard in<br/>
    Countries of greater heat, but lesser suction,<br/>
A green field is a sight which makes him pardon<br/>
    The absence of that more sublime construction,<br/>
Which mixes up vines, olives, precipices,<br/>
Glaciers, volcanos, oranges, and ices.<br/>
<br/>
And when I think upon a pot of beer&mdash;<br/>
    But I won&rsquo;t weep!&mdash;and so drive on, postilions!<br/>
As the smart boys spurr&rsquo;d fast in their career,<br/>
    Juan admired these highways of free millions;<br/>
A country in all senses the most dear<br/>
    To foreigner or native, save some silly ones,<br/>
Who &lsquo;kick against the pricks&rsquo; just at this juncture,<br/>
And for their pains get only a fresh puncture.<br/>
<br/>
What a delightful thing &rsquo;s a turnpike road!<br/>
    So smooth, so level, such a mode of shaving<br/>
The earth, as scarce the eagle in the broad<br/>
    Air can accomplish, with his wide wings waving.<br/>
Had such been cut in Phaeton&rsquo;s time, the god<br/>
    Had told his son to satisfy his craving<br/>
With the York mail;&mdash;but onward as we roll,<br/>
&lsquo;Surgit amari aliquid&rsquo;&mdash;the toll<br/>
<br/>
Alas, how deeply painful is all payment!<br/>
    Take lives, take wives, take aught except men&rsquo;s purses:<br/>
As Machiavel shows those in purple raiment,<br/>
    Such is the shortest way to general curses.<br/>
They hate a murderer much less than a claimant<br/>
    On that sweet ore which every body nurses;&mdash;<br/>
Kill a man&rsquo;s family, and he may brook it,<br/>
But keep your hands out of his breeches&rsquo; pocket.<br/>
<br/>
So said the Florentine: ye monarchs, hearken<br/>
    To your instructor. Juan now was borne,<br/>
Just as the day began to wane and darken,<br/>
    O&rsquo;er the high hill, which looks with pride or scorn<br/>
Toward the great city.&mdash;Ye who have a spark in<br/>
    Your veins of Cockney spirit, smile or mourn<br/>
According as you take things well or ill;&mdash;<br/>
Bold Britons, we are now on Shooter&rsquo;s Hill!<br/>
<br/>
The sun went down, the smoke rose up, as from<br/>
    A half-unquench&rsquo;d volcano, o&rsquo;er a space<br/>
Which well beseem&rsquo;d the &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s drawing-room,&rsquo;<br/>
    As some have qualified that wondrous place:<br/>
But Juan felt, though not approaching home,<br/>
    As one who, though he were not of the race,<br/>
Revered the soil, of those true sons the mother,<br/>
Who butcher&rsquo;d half the earth, and bullied t&rsquo; other.<br/>
<br/>
A mighty mass of brick, and smoke, and shipping,<br/>
    Dirty and dusky, but as wide as eye<br/>
Could reach, with here and there a sail just skipping<br/>
    In sight, then lost amidst the forestry<br/>
Of masts; a wilderness of steeples peeping<br/>
    On tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy;<br/>
A huge, dun cupola, like a foolscap crown<br/>
On a fool&rsquo;s head&mdash;and there is London Town!<br/>
<br/>
But Juan saw not this: each wreath of smoke<br/>
    Appear&rsquo;d to him but as the magic vapour<br/>
Of some alchymic furnace, from whence broke<br/>
    The wealth of worlds (a wealth of tax and paper):<br/>
The gloomy clouds, which o&rsquo;er it as a yoke<br/>
    Are bow&rsquo;d, and put the sun out like a taper,<br/>
Were nothing but the natural atmosphere,<br/>
Extremely wholesome, though but rarely clear.<br/>
<br/>
He paused&mdash;and so will I; as doth a crew<br/>
    Before they give their broadside. By and by,<br/>
My gentle countrymen, we will renew<br/>
    Our old acquaintance; and at least I&rsquo;ll try<br/>
To tell you truths you will not take as true,<br/>
    Because they are so;&mdash;a male Mrs. Fry,<br/>
With a soft besom will I sweep your halls,<br/>
And brush a web or two from off the walls.<br/>
<br/>
O Mrs. Fry! Why go to Newgate? Why<br/>
    Preach to poor rogues? And wherefore not begin<br/>
With Carlton, or with other houses? Try<br/>
    Your head at harden&rsquo;d and imperial sin.<br/>
To mend the people &rsquo;s an absurdity,<br/>
    A jargon, a mere philanthropic din,<br/>
Unless you make their betters better:&mdash;Fy!<br/>
I thought you had more religion, Mrs. Fry.<br/>
<br/>
Teach them the decencies of good threescore;<br/>
    Cure them of tours, hussar and highland dresses;<br/>
Tell them that youth once gone returns no more,<br/>
    That hired huzzas redeem no land&rsquo;s distresses;<br/>
Tell them Sir William Curtis is a bore,<br/>
    Too dull even for the dullest of excesses,<br/>
The witless Falstaff of a hoary Hal,<br/>
A fool whose bells have ceased to ring at all.<br/>
<br/>
Tell them, though it may be perhaps too late,<br/>
    On life&rsquo;s worn confine, jaded, bloated, sated,<br/>
To set up vain pretence of being great,<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis not so to be good; and be it stated,<br/>
The worthiest kings have ever loved least state;<br/>
    And tell them&mdash;But you won&rsquo;t, and I have prated<br/>
Just now enough; but by and by I&rsquo;ll prattle<br/>
Like Roland&rsquo;s horn in Roncesvalles&rsquo; battle.<br/>

<h2><a name="2H_4_0012"></a>
CANTO THE ELEVENTH.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
When Bishop Berkeley said &lsquo;there was no matter,&rsquo;<br/>
    And proved it&mdash;&rsquo;twas no matter what he said:<br/>
They say his system &rsquo;tis in vain to batter,<br/>
    Too subtle for the airiest human head;<br/>
And yet who can believe it? I would shatter<br/>
    Gladly all matters down to stone or lead,<br/>
Or adamant, to find the world a spirit,<br/>
And wear my head, denying that I wear it.<br/>
<br/>
What a sublime discovery &rsquo;twas to make the<br/>
    Universe universal egotism,<br/>
That all &rsquo;s ideal&mdash;all ourselves: I&rsquo;ll stake the<br/>
    World (be it what you will) that that &rsquo;s no schism.<br/>
O Doubt!&mdash;if thou be&rsquo;st Doubt, for which some take thee;<br/>
    But which I doubt extremely&mdash;thou sole prism<br/>
Of the Truth&rsquo;s rays, spoil not my draught of spirit!<br/>
Heaven&rsquo;s brandy, though our brain can hardly bear it.<br/>
<br/>
For ever and anon comes Indigestion,<br/>
    (Not the most &lsquo;dainty Ariel&rsquo;) and perplexes<br/>
Our soarings with another sort of question:<br/>
    And that which after all my spirit vexes,<br/>
Is, that I find no spot where man can rest eye on,<br/>
    Without confusion of the sorts and sexes,<br/>
Of beings, stars, and this unriddled wonder,<br/>
The world, which at the worst &rsquo;s a glorious blunder&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
If it be chance; or if it be according<br/>
    To the old text, still better:&mdash;lest it should<br/>
Turn out so, we&rsquo;ll say nothing &rsquo;gainst the wording,<br/>
    As several people think such hazards rude.<br/>
They&rsquo;re right; our days are too brief for affording<br/>
    Space to dispute what no one ever could<br/>
Decide, and every body one day will<br/>
Know very clearly&mdash;or at least lie still.<br/>
<br/>
And therefore will I leave off metaphysical<br/>
    Discussion, which is neither here nor there:<br/>
If I agree that what is, is; then this I call<br/>
    Being quite perspicuous and extremely fair;<br/>
The truth is, I&rsquo;ve grown lately rather phthisical:<br/>
    I don&rsquo;t know what the reason is&mdash;the air<br/>
Perhaps; but as I suffer from the shocks<br/>
Of illness, I grow much more orthodox.<br/>
<br/>
The first attack at once proved the Divinity<br/>
    (But that I never doubted, nor the Devil);<br/>
The next, the Virgin&rsquo;s mystical virginity;<br/>
    The third, the usual Origin of Evil;<br/>
The fourth at once establish&rsquo;d the whole Trinity<br/>
    On so uncontrovertible a level,<br/>
That I devoutly wish&rsquo;d the three were four,<br/>
On purpose to believe so much the more.<br/>
<br/>
To our Theme.&mdash;The man who has stood on the Acropolis,<br/>
    And look&rsquo;d down over Attica; or he<br/>
Who has sail&rsquo;d where picturesque Constantinople is,<br/>
    Or seen Timbuctoo, or hath taken tea<br/>
In small-eyed China&rsquo;s crockery-ware metropolis,<br/>
    Or sat amidst the bricks of Nineveh,<br/>
May not think much of London&rsquo;s first appearance&mdash;<br/>
But ask him what he thinks of it a year hence?<br/>
<br/>
Don Juan had got out on Shooter&rsquo;s Hill;<br/>
    Sunset the time, the place the same declivity<br/>
Which looks along that vale of good and ill<br/>
    Where London streets ferment in full activity;<br/>
While every thing around was calm and still,<br/>
    Except the creak of wheels, which on their pivot he<br/>
Heard,&mdash;and that bee-like, bubbling, busy hum<br/>
Of cities, that boil over with their scum:&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
I say, Don Juan, wrapt in contemplation,<br/>
    Walk&rsquo;d on behind his carriage, o&rsquo;er the summit,<br/>
And lost in wonder of so great a nation,<br/>
    Gave way to &rsquo;t, since he could not overcome it.<br/>
&lsquo;And here,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;is Freedom&rsquo;s chosen station;<br/>
    Here peals the people&rsquo;s voice, nor can entomb it<br/>
Racks, prisons, inquisitions; resurrection<br/>
Awaits it, each new meeting or election.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Here are chaste wives, pure lives; here people pay<br/>
    But what they please; and if that things be dear,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis only that they love to throw away<br/>
    Their cash, to show how much they have a-year.<br/>
Here laws are all inviolate; none lay<br/>
    Traps for the traveller; every highway &rsquo;s clear:<br/>
Here-&rsquo; he was interrupted by a knife,<br/>
With,&mdash;&lsquo;Damn your eyes! your money or your life!&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
These freeborn sounds proceeded from four pads<br/>
    In ambush laid, who had perceived him loiter<br/>
Behind his carriage; and, like handy lads,<br/>
    Had seized the lucky hour to reconnoitre,<br/>
In which the heedless gentleman who gads<br/>
    Upon the road, unless he prove a fighter,<br/>
May find himself within that isle of riches<br/>
Exposed to lose his life as well as breeches.<br/>
<br/>
Juan, who did not understand a word<br/>
    Of English, save their shibboleth, &lsquo;God damn!&rsquo;<br/>
And even that he had so rarely heard,<br/>
    He sometimes thought &rsquo;twas only their &lsquo;Salam,&rsquo;<br/>
Or &lsquo;God be with you!&rsquo;&mdash;and &rsquo;tis not absurd<br/>
    To think so: for half English as I am<br/>
(To my misfortune), never can I say<br/>
I heard them wish &lsquo;God with you,&rsquo; save that way;&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Juan yet quickly understood their gesture,<br/>
    And being somewhat choleric and sudden,<br/>
Drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture,<br/>
    And fired it into one assailant&rsquo;s pudding&mdash;<br/>
Who fell, as rolls an ox o&rsquo;er in his pasture,<br/>
    And roar&rsquo;d out, as he writhed his native mud in,<br/>
Unto his nearest follower or henchman,<br/>
&lsquo;Oh Jack! I&rsquo;m floor&rsquo;d by that &rsquo;ere bloody Frenchman!&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
On which Jack and his train set off at speed,<br/>
    And Juan&rsquo;s suite, late scatter&rsquo;d at a distance,<br/>
Came up, all marvelling at such a deed,<br/>
    And offering, as usual, late assistance.<br/>
Juan, who saw the moon&rsquo;s late minion bleed<br/>
    As if his veins would pour out his existence,<br/>
Stood calling out for bandages and lint,<br/>
And wish&rsquo;d he had been less hasty with his flint.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; thought he, &lsquo;it is the country&rsquo;s wont<br/>
    To welcome foreigners in this way: now<br/>
I recollect some innkeepers who don&rsquo;t<br/>
    Differ, except in robbing with a bow,<br/>
In lieu of a bare blade and brazen front.<br/>
    But what is to be done? I can&rsquo;t allow<br/>
The fellow to lie groaning on the road:<br/>
So take him up; I&rsquo;ll help you with the load.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
But ere they could perform this pious duty,<br/>
    The dying man cried, &lsquo;Hold! I&rsquo;ve got my gruel!<br/>
O for a glass of max! We&rsquo;ve miss&rsquo;d our booty;<br/>
    Let me die where I am!&rsquo; And as the fuel<br/>
Of life shrunk in his heart, and thick and sooty<br/>
    The drops fell from his death-wound, and he drew ill<br/>
His breath,&mdash;he from his swelling throat untied<br/>
A kerchief, crying, &lsquo;Give Sal that!&rsquo;&mdash;and died.<br/>
<br/>
The cravat stain&rsquo;d with bloody drops fell down<br/>
    Before Don Juan&rsquo;s feet: he could not tell<br/>
Exactly why it was before him thrown,<br/>
    Nor what the meaning of the man&rsquo;s farewell.<br/>
Poor Tom was once a kiddy upon town,<br/>
    A thorough varmint, and a real swell,<br/>
Full flash, all fancy, until fairly diddled,<br/>
His pockets first and then his body riddled.<br/>
<br/>
Don Juan, having done the best he could<br/>
    In all the circumstances of the case,<br/>
As soon as &lsquo;Crowner&rsquo;s quest&rsquo; allow&rsquo;d, pursued<br/>
    His travels to the capital apace;&mdash;<br/>
Esteeming it a little hard he should<br/>
    In twelve hours&rsquo; time, and very little space,<br/>
Have been obliged to slay a freeborn native<br/>
In self-defence: this made him meditative.<br/>
<br/>
He from the world had cut off a great man,<br/>
    Who in his time had made heroic bustle.<br/>
Who in a row like Tom could lead the van,<br/>
    Booze in the ken, or at the spellken hustle?<br/>
Who queer a flat? Who (spite of Bow Street&rsquo;s ban)<br/>
    On the high toby-spice so flash the muzzle?<br/>
Who on a lark, with black-eyed Sal (his blowing),<br/>
So prime, so swell, so nutty, and so knowing?<br/>
<br/>
But Tom&rsquo;s no more&mdash;and so no more of Tom.<br/>
    Heroes must die; and by God&rsquo;s blessing &rsquo;tis<br/>
Not long before the most of them go home.<br/>
    Hail! Thamis, Hail! Upon thy verge it is<br/>
That Juan&rsquo;s chariot, rolling like a drum<br/>
    In thunder, holds the way it can&rsquo;t well miss,<br/>
Through Kennington and all the other &lsquo;tons,&rsquo;<br/>
Which makes us wish ourselves in town at once;&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Through Groves, so call&rsquo;d as being void of trees<br/>
    (Like lucus from no light); through prospects named<br/>
Mount Pleasant, as containing nought to please,<br/>
    Nor much to climb; through little boxes framed<br/>
Of bricks, to let the dust in at your ease,<br/>
    With &lsquo;To be let&rsquo; upon their doors proclaim&rsquo;d;<br/>
Through &lsquo;Rows&rsquo; most modestly call&rsquo;d &lsquo;Paradise,&rsquo;<br/>
Which Eve might quit without much sacrifice;&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Through coaches, drays, choked turnpikes, and a whirl<br/>
    Of wheels, and roar of voices, and confusion;<br/>
Here taverns wooing to a pint of &lsquo;purl,&rsquo;<br/>
    There mails fast flying off like a delusion;<br/>
There barbers&rsquo; blocks with periwigs in curl<br/>
    In windows; here the lamplighter&rsquo;s infusion<br/>
Slowly distill&rsquo;d into the glimmering glass<br/>
(For in those days we had not got to gas);&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Through this, and much, and more, is the approach<br/>
    Of travellers to mighty Babylon:<br/>
Whether they come by horse, or chaise, or coach,<br/>
    With slight exceptions, all the ways seem one.<br/>
I could say more, but do not choose to encroach<br/>
    Upon the Guide-book&rsquo;s privilege. The sun<br/>
Had set some time, and night was on the ridge<br/>
Of twilight, as the party cross&rsquo;d the bridge,&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
That &rsquo;s rather fine. The gentle sound of Thamis&mdash;<br/>
    Who vindicates a moment, too, his stream,<br/>
Though hardly heard through multifarious &lsquo;damme&rsquo;s&rsquo;-<br/>
    The lamps of Westminster&rsquo;s more regular gleam,<br/>
The breadth of pavement, and yon shrine where fame is<br/>
    A spectral resident&mdash;whose pallid beam<br/>
In shape of moonshine hovers o&rsquo;er the pile&mdash;<br/>
Make this a sacred part of Albion&rsquo;s isle.<br/>
<br/>
The Druids&rsquo; groves are gone&mdash;so much the better:<br/>
    Stone-Henge is not&mdash;but what the devil is it?-<br/>
But Bedlam still exists with its sage fetter,<br/>
    That madmen may not bite you on a visit;<br/>
The Bench too seats or suits full many a debtor;<br/>
    The Mansion House too (though some people quiz it)<br/>
To me appears a stiff yet grand erection;<br/>
But then the Abbey &rsquo;s worth the whole collection.<br/>
<br/>
The line of lights, too, up to Charing Cross,<br/>
    Pall Mall, and so forth, have a coruscation<br/>
Like gold as in comparison to dross,<br/>
    Match&rsquo;d with the Continent&rsquo;s illumination,<br/>
Whose cities Night by no means deigns to gloss.<br/>
    The French were not yet a lamp-lighting nation,<br/>
And when they grew so&mdash;on their new-found lantern,<br/>
Instead of wicks, they made a wicked man turn.<br/>
<br/>
A row of gentlemen along the streets<br/>
    Suspended may illuminate mankind,<br/>
As also bonfires made of country seats;<br/>
    But the old way is best for the purblind:<br/>
The other looks like phosphorus on sheets,<br/>
    A sort of ignis fatuus to the mind,<br/>
Which, though &rsquo;tis certain to perplex and frighten,<br/>
Must burn more mildly ere it can enlighten.<br/>
<br/>
But London &rsquo;s so well lit, that if Diogenes<br/>
    Could recommence to hunt his honest man,<br/>
And found him not amidst the various progenies<br/>
    Of this enormous city&rsquo;s spreading span,<br/>
&rsquo;Twere not for want of lamps to aid his dodging his<br/>
    Yet undiscover&rsquo;d treasure. What I can,<br/>
I&rsquo;ve done to find the same throughout life&rsquo;s journey,<br/>
But see the world is only one attorney.<br/>
<br/>
Over the stones still rattling up Pall Mall,<br/>
    Through crowds and carriages, but waxing thinner<br/>
As thunder&rsquo;d knockers broke the long seal&rsquo;d spell<br/>
    Of doors &rsquo;gainst duns, and to an early dinner<br/>
Admitted a small party as night fell,&mdash;<br/>
    Don Juan, our young diplomatic sinner,<br/>
Pursued his path, and drove past some hotels,<br/>
St. James&rsquo;s Palace and St. James&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hells.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
They reach&rsquo;d the hotel: forth stream&rsquo;d from the front door<br/>
    A tide of well-clad waiters, and around<br/>
The mob stood, and as usual several score<br/>
    Of those pedestrian Paphians who abound<br/>
In decent London when the daylight &rsquo;s o&rsquo;er;<br/>
    Commodious but immoral, they are found<br/>
Useful, like Malthus, in promoting marriage.-<br/>
But Juan now is stepping from his carriage<br/>
<br/>
Into one of the sweetest of hotels,<br/>
    Especially for foreigners&mdash;and mostly<br/>
For those whom favour or whom fortune swells,<br/>
    And cannot find a bill&rsquo;s small items costly.<br/>
There many an envoy either dwelt or dwells<br/>
    (The den of many a diplomatic lost lie),<br/>
Until to some conspicuous square they pass,<br/>
And blazon o&rsquo;er the door their names in brass.<br/>
<br/>
Juan, whose was a delicate commission,<br/>
    Private, though publicly important, bore<br/>
No title to point out with due precision<br/>
    The exact affair on which he was sent o&rsquo;er.<br/>
&rsquo;Twas merely known, that on a secret mission<br/>
    A foreigner of rank had graced our shore,<br/>
Young, handsome, and accomplish&rsquo;d, who was said<br/>
(In whispers) to have turn&rsquo;d his sovereign&rsquo;s head.<br/>
<br/>
Some rumour also of some strange adventures<br/>
    Had gone before him, and his wars and loves;<br/>
And as romantic heads are pretty painters,<br/>
    And, above all, an Englishwoman&rsquo;s roves<br/>
Into the excursive, breaking the indentures<br/>
    Of sober reason wheresoe&rsquo;er it moves,<br/>
He found himself extremely in the fashion,<br/>
Which serves our thinking people for a passion.<br/>
<br/>
I don&rsquo;t mean that they are passionless, but quite<br/>
    The contrary; but then &rsquo;tis in the head;<br/>
Yet as the consequences are as bright<br/>
    As if they acted with the heart instead,<br/>
What after all can signify the site<br/>
    Of ladies&rsquo; lucubrations? So they lead<br/>
In safety to the place for which you start,<br/>
What matters if the road be head or heart?<br/>
<br/>
Juan presented in the proper place,<br/>
    To proper placemen, every Russ credential;<br/>
And was received with all the due grimace<br/>
    By those who govern in the mood potential,<br/>
Who, seeing a handsome stripling with smooth face,<br/>
    Thought (what in state affairs is most essential)<br/>
That they as easily might do the youngster,<br/>
As hawks may pounce upon a woodland songster.<br/>
<br/>
They err&rsquo;d, as aged men will do; but by<br/>
    And by we&rsquo;ll talk of that; and if we don&rsquo;t,<br/>
&rsquo;Twill be because our notion is not high<br/>
    Of politicians and their double front,<br/>
Who live by lies, yet dare not boldly lie:&mdash;<br/>
    Now what I love in women is, they won&rsquo;t<br/>
Or can&rsquo;t do otherwise than lie, but do it<br/>
So well, the very truth seems falsehood to it.<br/>
<br/>
And, after all, what is a lie? &rsquo;Tis but<br/>
    The truth in masquerade; and I defy<br/>
Historians, heroes, lawyers, priests, to put<br/>
    A fact without some leaven of a lie.<br/>
The very shadow of true Truth would shut<br/>
    Up annals, revelations, poesy,<br/>
And prophecy&mdash;except it should be dated<br/>
Some years before the incidents related.<br/>
<br/>
Praised be all liars and all lies! Who now<br/>
    Can tax my mild Muse with misanthropy?<br/>
She rings the world&rsquo;s &lsquo;Te Deum,&rsquo; and her brow<br/>
    Blushes for those who will not:&mdash;but to sigh<br/>
Is idle; let us like most others bow,<br/>
    Kiss hands, feet, any part of majesty,<br/>
After the good example of &lsquo;Green Erin,&rsquo;<br/>
Whose shamrock now seems rather worse for wearing.<br/>
<br/>
Don Juan was presented, and his dress<br/>
    And mien excited general admiration&mdash;<br/>
I don&rsquo;t know which was more admired or less:<br/>
    One monstrous diamond drew much observation,<br/>
Which Catherine in a moment of &lsquo;ivresse&rsquo;<br/>
    (In love or brandy&rsquo;s fervent fermentation)<br/>
Bestow&rsquo;d upon him, as the public learn&rsquo;d;<br/>
And, to say truth, it had been fairly earn&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the ministers and underlings,<br/>
    Who must be courteous to the accredited<br/>
Diplomatists of rather wavering kings,<br/>
    Until their royal riddle &rsquo;s fully read,<br/>
The very clerks,&mdash;those somewhat dirty springs<br/>
    Of office, or the house of office, fed<br/>
By foul corruption into streams,&mdash;even they<br/>
Were hardly rude enough to earn their pay:<br/>
<br/>
And insolence no doubt is what they are<br/>
    Employ&rsquo;d for, since it is their daily labour,<br/>
In the dear offices of peace or war;<br/>
    And should you doubt, pray ask of your next neighbour,<br/>
When for a passport, or some other bar<br/>
    To freedom, he applied (a grief and a bore),<br/>
If he found not his spawn of taxborn riches,<br/>
<br/>
But Juan was received with much &lsquo;empressement:&rsquo;-<br/>
    These phrases of refinement I must borrow<br/>
From our next neighbours&rsquo; land, where, like a chessman,<br/>
    There is a move set down for joy or sorrow<br/>
Not only in mere talking, but the press. Man<br/>
    In islands is, it seems, downright and thorough,<br/>
More than on continents&mdash;as if the sea<br/>
(See Billingsgate) made even the tongue more free.<br/>
<br/>
And yet the British &lsquo;Damme&rsquo; &rsquo;s rather Attic:<br/>
    Your continental oaths are but incontinent,<br/>
And turn on things which no aristocratic<br/>
    Spirit would name, and therefore even I won&rsquo;t anent<br/>
This subject quote; as it would be schismatic<br/>
    In politesse, and have a sound affronting in &rsquo;t:&mdash;<br/>
But &lsquo;Damme&rsquo; &rsquo;s quite ethereal, though too daring&mdash;<br/>
Platonic blasphemy, the soul of swearing.<br/>
<br/>
For downright rudeness, ye may stay at home;<br/>
    For true or false politeness (and scarce that<br/>
Now) you may cross the blue deep and white foam&mdash;<br/>
    The first the emblem (rarely though) of what<br/>
You leave behind, the next of much you come<br/>
    To meet. However, &rsquo;tis no time to chat<br/>
On general topics: poems must confine<br/>
Themselves to unity, like this of mine.<br/>
<br/>
In the great world,&mdash;which, being interpreted,<br/>
    Meaneth the west or worst end of a city,<br/>
And about twice two thousand people bred<br/>
    By no means to be very wise or witty,<br/>
But to sit up while others lie in bed,<br/>
    And look down on the universe with pity,&mdash;<br/>
Juan, as an inveterate patrician,<br/>
Was well received by persons of condition.<br/>
<br/>
He was a bachelor, which is a matter<br/>
    Of import both to virgin and to bride,<br/>
The former&rsquo;s hymeneal hopes to flatter;<br/>
    And (should she not hold fast by love or pride)<br/>
&rsquo;Tis also of some moment to the latter:<br/>
    A rib &rsquo;s a thorn in a wed gallant&rsquo;s side,<br/>
Requires decorum, and is apt to double<br/>
The horrid sin&mdash;and what &rsquo;s still worse, the trouble.<br/>
<br/>
But Juan was a bachelor&mdash;of arts,<br/>
    And parts, and hearts: he danced and sung, and had<br/>
An air as sentimental as Mozart&rsquo;s<br/>
    Softest of melodies; and could be sad<br/>
Or cheerful, without any &lsquo;flaws or starts,&rsquo;<br/>
    Just at the proper time; and though a lad,<br/>
Had seen the world&mdash;which is a curious sight,<br/>
And very much unlike what people write.<br/>
<br/>
Fair virgins blush&rsquo;d upon him; wedded dames<br/>
    Bloom&rsquo;d also in less transitory hues;<br/>
For both commodities dwell by the Thames,<br/>
    The painting and the painted; youth, ceruse,<br/>
Against his heart preferr&rsquo;d their usual claims,<br/>
    Such as no gentleman can quite refuse:<br/>
Daughters admired his dress, and pious mothers<br/>
Inquired his income, and if he had brothers.<br/>
<br/>
The milliners who furnish &lsquo;drapery Misses&rsquo;<br/>
    Throughout the season, upon speculation<br/>
Of payment ere the honey-moon&rsquo;s last kisses<br/>
    Have waned into a crescent&rsquo;s coruscation,<br/>
Thought such an opportunity as this is,<br/>
    Of a rich foreigner&rsquo;s initiation,<br/>
Not to be overlook&rsquo;d&mdash;and gave such credit,<br/>
That future bridegrooms swore, and sigh&rsquo;d, and paid it.<br/>
<br/>
The Blues, that tender tribe who sigh o&rsquo;er sonnets,<br/>
    And with the pages of the last Review<br/>
Line the interior of their heads or bonnets,<br/>
    Advanced in all their azure&rsquo;s highest hue:<br/>
They talk&rsquo;d bad French or Spanish, and upon its<br/>
    Late authors ask&rsquo;d him for a hint or two;<br/>
And which was softest, Russian or Castilian?<br/>
And whether in his travels he saw Ilion?<br/>
<br/>
Juan, who was a little superficial,<br/>
    And not in literature a great Drawcansir,<br/>
Examined by this learned and especial<br/>
    Jury of matrons, scarce knew what to answer:<br/>
His duties warlike, loving or official,<br/>
    His steady application as a dancer,<br/>
Had kept him from the brink of Hippocrene,<br/>
Which now he found was blue instead of green.<br/>
<br/>
However, he replied at hazard, with<br/>
    A modest confidence and calm assurance,<br/>
Which lent his learned lucubrations pith,<br/>
    And pass&rsquo;d for arguments of good endurance.<br/>
That prodigy, Miss Araminta Smith<br/>
    (Who at sixteen translated &lsquo;Hercules Furens&rsquo;<br/>
Into as furious English), with her best look,<br/>
Set down his sayings in her common-place book.<br/>
<br/>
Juan knew several languages&mdash;as well<br/>
    He might&mdash;and brought them up with skill, in time<br/>
To save his fame with each accomplish&rsquo;d belle,<br/>
    Who still regretted that he did not rhyme.<br/>
There wanted but this requisite to swell<br/>
    His qualities (with them) into sublime:<br/>
Lady Fitz-Frisky, and Miss Maevia Mannish,<br/>
Both long&rsquo;d extremely to be sung in Spanish.<br/>
<br/>
However, he did pretty well, and was<br/>
    Admitted as an aspirant to all<br/>
The coteries, and, as in Banquo&rsquo;s glass,<br/>
    At great assemblies or in parties small,<br/>
He saw ten thousand living authors pass,<br/>
    That being about their average numeral;<br/>
Also the eighty &lsquo;greatest living poets,&rsquo;<br/>
As every paltry magazine can show its.<br/>
<br/>
In twice five years the &lsquo;greatest living poet,&rsquo;<br/>
    Like to the champion in the fisty ring,<br/>
Is call&rsquo;d on to support his claim, or show it,<br/>
    Although &rsquo;tis an imaginary thing.<br/>
Even I&mdash;albeit I&rsquo;m sure I did not know it,<br/>
    Nor sought of foolscap subjects to be king&mdash;<br/>
Was reckon&rsquo;d a considerable time,<br/>
The grand Napoleon of the realms of rhyme.<br/>
<br/>
But Juan was my Moscow, and Faliero<br/>
    My Leipsic, and my Mount Saint Jean seems Cain:<br/>
&lsquo;La Belle Alliance&rsquo; of dunces down at zero,<br/>
    Now that the Lion &rsquo;s fall&rsquo;n, may rise again:<br/>
But I will fall at least as fell my hero;<br/>
    Nor reign at all, or as a monarch reign;<br/>
Or to some lonely isle of gaolers go,<br/>
With turncoat Southey for my turnkey Lowe.<br/>
<br/>
Sir Walter reign&rsquo;d before me; Moore and Campbell<br/>
    Before and after; but now grown more holy,<br/>
The Muses upon Sion&rsquo;s hill must ramble<br/>
    With poets almost clergymen, or wholly;<br/>
And Pegasus hath a psalmodic amble<br/>
    Beneath the very Reverend Rowley Powley,<br/>
Who shoes the glorious animal with stilts,<br/>
A modern Ancient Pistol&mdash;by the hilts?<br/>
<br/>
Then there&rsquo;s my gentle Euphues, who, they say,<br/>
    Sets up for being a sort of moral me;<br/>
He&rsquo;ll find it rather difficult some day<br/>
    To turn out both, or either, it may be.<br/>
Some persons think that Coleridge hath the sway;<br/>
    And Wordsworth has supporters, two or three;<br/>
And that deep-mouth&rsquo;d Boeotian &lsquo;Savage Landor&rsquo;<br/>
Has taken for a swan rogue Southey&rsquo;s gander.<br/>
<br/>
John Keats, who was kill&rsquo;d off by one critique,<br/>
    Just as he really promised something great,<br/>
If not intelligible, without Greek<br/>
    Contrived to talk about the gods of late,<br/>
Much as they might have been supposed to speak.<br/>
    Poor fellow! His was an untoward fate;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis strange the mind, that very fiery particle,<br/>
Should let itself be snuff&rsquo;d out by an article.<br/>
<br/>
The list grows long of live and dead pretenders<br/>
    To that which none will gain&mdash;or none will know<br/>
The conqueror at least; who, ere Time renders<br/>
    His last award, will have the long grass grow<br/>
Above his burnt-out brain, and sapless cinders.<br/>
    If I might augur, I should rate but low<br/>
Their chances; they&rsquo;re too numerous, like the thirty<br/>
Mock tyrants, when Rome&rsquo;s annals wax&rsquo;d but dirty.<br/>
<br/>
This is the literary lower empire,<br/>
    Where the praetorian bands take up the matter;&mdash;<br/>
A &lsquo;dreadful trade,&rsquo; like his who &lsquo;gathers samphire,&rsquo;<br/>
    The insolent soldiery to soothe and flatter,<br/>
With the same feelings as you&rsquo;d coax a vampire.<br/>
    Now, were I once at home, and in good satire,<br/>
I&rsquo;d try conclusions with those Janizaries,<br/>
And show them what an intellectual war is.<br/>
<br/>
I think I know a trick or two, would turn<br/>
    Their flanks;&mdash;but it is hardly worth my while<br/>
With such small gear to give myself concern:<br/>
    Indeed I&rsquo;ve not the necessary bile;<br/>
My natural temper &rsquo;s really aught but stern,<br/>
    And even my Muse&rsquo;s worst reproof &rsquo;s a smile;<br/>
And then she drops a brief and modern curtsy,<br/>
And glides away, assured she never hurts ye.<br/>
<br/>
My Juan, whom I left in deadly peril<br/>
    Amongst live poets and blue ladies, past<br/>
With some small profit through that field so sterile,<br/>
    Being tired in time, and, neither least nor last,<br/>
Left it before he had been treated very ill;<br/>
    And henceforth found himself more gaily class&rsquo;d<br/>
Amongst the higher spirits of the day,<br/>
The sun&rsquo;s true son, no vapour, but a ray.<br/>
<br/>
His morns he pass&rsquo;d in business&mdash;which, dissected,<br/>
    Was like all business a laborious nothing<br/>
That leads to lassitude, the most infected<br/>
    And Centaur Nessus garb of mortal clothing,<br/>
And on our sofas makes us lie dejected,<br/>
    And talk in tender horrors of our loathing<br/>
All kinds of toil, save for our country&rsquo;s good&mdash;<br/>
Which grows no better, though &rsquo;tis time it should.<br/>
<br/>
His afternoons he pass&rsquo;d in visits, luncheons,<br/>
    Lounging and boxing; and the twilight hour<br/>
In riding round those vegetable puncheons<br/>
    Call&rsquo;d &lsquo;Parks,&rsquo; where there is neither fruit nor flower<br/>
Enough to gratify a bee&rsquo;s slight munchings;<br/>
    But after all it is the only &lsquo;bower&rsquo;<br/>
(In Moore&rsquo;s phrase), where the fashionable fair<br/>
Can form a slight acquaintance with fresh air.<br/>
<br/>
Then dress, then dinner, then awakes the world!<br/>
    Then glare the lamps, then whirl the wheels, then roar<br/>
Through street and square fast flashing chariots hurl&rsquo;d<br/>
    Like harness&rsquo;d meteors; then along the floor<br/>
Chalk mimics painting; then festoons are twirl&rsquo;d;<br/>
    Then roll the brazen thunders of the door,<br/>
Which opens to the thousand happy few<br/>
An earthly paradise of &lsquo;Or Molu.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
There stands the noble hostess, nor shall sink<br/>
    With the three-thousandth curtsy; there the waltz,<br/>
The only dance which teaches girls to think,<br/>
    Makes one in love even with its very faults.<br/>
Saloon, room, hall, o&rsquo;erflow beyond their brink,<br/>
    And long the latest of arrivals halts,<br/>
&rsquo;Midst royal dukes and dames condemn&rsquo;d to climb,<br/>
And gain an inch of staircase at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Thrice happy he who, after a survey<br/>
    Of the good company, can win a corner,<br/>
A door that&rsquo;s in or boudoir out of the way,<br/>
    Where he may fix himself like small &lsquo;Jack Horner,&rsquo;<br/>
And let the Babel round run as it may,<br/>
    And look on as a mourner, or a scorner,<br/>
Or an approver, or a mere spectator,<br/>
Yawning a little as the night grows later.<br/>
<br/>
But this won&rsquo;t do, save by and by; and he<br/>
    Who, like Don Juan, takes an active share,<br/>
Must steer with care through all that glittering sea<br/>
    Of gems and plumes and pearls and silks, to where<br/>
He deems it is his proper place to be;<br/>
    Dissolving in the waltz to some soft air,<br/>
Or proudlier prancing with mercurial skill<br/>
Where Science marshals forth her own quadrille.<br/>
<br/>
Or, if he dance not, but hath higher views<br/>
    Upon an heiress or his neighbour&rsquo;s bride,<br/>
Let him take care that that which he pursues<br/>
    Is not at once too palpably descried.<br/>
Full many an eager gentleman oft rues<br/>
    His haste: impatience is a blundering guide,<br/>
Amongst a people famous for reflection,<br/>
Who like to play the fool with circumspection.<br/>
<br/>
But, if you can contrive, get next at supper;<br/>
    Or, if forestalled, get opposite and ogle:&mdash;<br/>
O, ye ambrosial moments! always upper<br/>
    In mind, a sort of sentimental bogle,<br/>
Which sits for ever upon memory&rsquo;s crupper,<br/>
    The ghost of vanish&rsquo;d pleasures once in vogue! Ill<br/>
Can tender souls relate the rise and fall<br/>
Of hopes and fears which shake a single ball.<br/>
<br/>
But these precautionary hints can touch<br/>
    Only the common run, who must pursue,<br/>
And watch, and ward; whose plans a word too much<br/>
    Or little overturns; and not the few<br/>
Or many (for the number&rsquo;s sometimes such)<br/>
    Whom a good mien, especially if new,<br/>
Or fame, or name, for wit, war, sense, or nonsense,<br/>
Permits whate&rsquo;er they please, or did not long since.<br/>
<br/>
Our hero, as a hero, young and handsome,<br/>
    Noble, rich, celebrated, and a stranger,<br/>
Like other slaves of course must pay his ransom,<br/>
    Before he can escape from so much danger<br/>
As will environ a conspicuous man. Some<br/>
    Talk about poetry, and &lsquo;rack and manger,&rsquo;<br/>
And ugliness, disease, as toil and trouble;&mdash;<br/>
I wish they knew the life of a young noble.<br/>
<br/>
They are young, but know not youth&mdash;it is anticipated;<br/>
    Handsome but wasted, rich without a sou;<br/>
Their vigour in a thousand arms is dissipated;<br/>
    Their cash comes from, their wealth goes to a Jew;<br/>
Both senates see their nightly votes participated<br/>
    Between the tyrant&rsquo;s and the tribunes&rsquo; crew;<br/>
And having voted, dined, drunk, gamed, and whored,<br/>
The family vault receives another lord.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Where is the world?&rsquo; cries Young, at eighty&mdash;&lsquo;Where<br/>
    The world in which a man was born? &lsquo;Alas!<br/>
Where is the world of eight years past? &rsquo;Twas there&mdash;<br/>
    I look for it&mdash;&rsquo;tis gone, a globe of glass!<br/>
Crack&rsquo;d, shiver&rsquo;d, vanish&rsquo;d, scarcely gazed on, ere<br/>
    A silent change dissolves the glittering mass.<br/>
Statesmen, chiefs, orators, queens, patriots, kings,<br/>
And dandies, all are gone on the wind&rsquo;s wings.<br/>
<br/>
Where is Napoleon the Grand? God knows.<br/>
    Where little Castlereagh? The devil can tell:<br/>
Where Grattan, Curran, Sheridan, all those<br/>
    Who bound the bar or senate in their spell?<br/>
Where is the unhappy Queen, with all her woes?<br/>
    And where the Daughter, whom the Isles loved well?<br/>
Where are those martyr&rsquo;d saints the Five per Cents?<br/>
And where&mdash;oh, where the devil are the rents?<br/>
<br/>
Where&rsquo;s Brummel? Dish&rsquo;d. Where&rsquo;s Long Pole Wellesley? Diddled.<br/>
    Where&rsquo;s Whitbread? Romilly? Where&rsquo;s George the Third?<br/>
Where is his will? (That &rsquo;s not so soon unriddled.)<br/>
    And where is &lsquo;Fum&rsquo; the Fourth, our &lsquo;royal bird?&rsquo;<br/>
Gone down, it seems, to Scotland to be fiddled<br/>
    Unto by Sawney&rsquo;s violin, we have heard:<br/>
&lsquo;Caw me, caw thee&rsquo;&mdash;for six months hath been hatching<br/>
This scene of royal itch and loyal scratching.<br/>
<br/>
Where is Lord This? And where my Lady That?<br/>
    The Honourable Mistresses and Misses?<br/>
Some laid aside like an old Opera hat,<br/>
    Married, unmarried, and remarried (this is<br/>
An evolution oft performed of late).<br/>
    Where are the Dublin shouts&mdash;and London hisses?<br/>
Where are the Grenvilles? Turn&rsquo;d as usual. Where<br/>
My friends the Whigs? Exactly where they were.<br/>
<br/>
Where are the Lady Carolines and Franceses?<br/>
    Divorced or doing thereanent. Ye annals<br/>
So brilliant, where the list of routs and dances is,&mdash;<br/>
    Thou Morning Post, sole record of the panels<br/>
Broken in carriages, and all the phantasies<br/>
    Of fashion,&mdash;say what streams now fill those channels?<br/>
Some die, some fly, some languish on the Continent,<br/>
Because the times have hardly left them one tenant.<br/>
<br/>
Some who once set their caps at cautious dukes,<br/>
    Have taken up at length with younger brothers:<br/>
Some heiresses have bit at sharpers&rsquo; hooks:<br/>
    Some maids have been made wives, some merely mothers;<br/>
Others have lost their fresh and fairy looks:<br/>
    In short, the list of alterations bothers.<br/>
There&rsquo;s little strange in this, but something strange is<br/>
The unusual quickness of these common changes.<br/>
<br/>
Talk not of seventy years as age; in seven<br/>
    I have seen more changes, down from monarchs to<br/>
The humblest individual under heaven,<br/>
    Than might suffice a moderate century through.<br/>
I knew that nought was lasting, but now even<br/>
    Change grows too changeable, without being new:<br/>
Nought &rsquo;s permanent among the human race,<br/>
Except the Whigs not getting into place.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen Napoleon, who seem&rsquo;d quite a Jupiter,<br/>
    Shrink to a Saturn. I have seen a Duke<br/>
(No matter which) turn politician stupider,<br/>
    If that can well be, than his wooden look.<br/>
But it is time that I should hoist my &lsquo;blue Peter,&rsquo;<br/>
    And sail for a new theme:&mdash;I have seen&mdash;and shook<br/>
To see it&mdash;the king hiss&rsquo;d, and then caress&rsquo;d;<br/>
But don&rsquo;t pretend to settle which was best.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen the Landholders without a rap&mdash;<br/>
    I have seen Joanna Southcote&mdash;I have seen&mdash;<br/>
The House of Commons turn&rsquo;d to a tax-trap&mdash;<br/>
    I have seen that sad affair of the late Queen&mdash;<br/>
I have seen crowns worn instead of a fool&rsquo;s cap&mdash;<br/>
    I have seen a Congress doing all that &rsquo;s mean&mdash;<br/>
I have seen some nations like o&rsquo;erloaded asses<br/>
Kick off their burthens, meaning the high classes.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen small poets, and great prosers, and<br/>
    Interminable&mdash;not eternal&mdash;speakers&mdash;<br/>
I have seen the funds at war with house and land&mdash;<br/>
    I have seen the country gentlemen turn squeakers&mdash;<br/>
I have seen the people ridden o&rsquo;er like sand<br/>
    By slaves on horseback&mdash;I have seen malt liquors<br/>
Exchanged for &lsquo;thin potations&rsquo; by John Bull&mdash;<br/>
I have seen john half detect himself a fool.-<br/>
<br/>
But &lsquo;carpe diem,&rsquo; Juan, &lsquo;carpe, carpe!&rsquo;<br/>
    To-morrow sees another race as gay<br/>
And transient, and devour&rsquo;d by the same harpy.<br/>
    &lsquo;Life &rsquo;s a poor player,&rsquo;&mdash;then &lsquo;play out the play,<br/>
Ye villains!&rsquo; above all keep a sharp eye<br/>
    Much less on what you do than what you say:<br/>
Be hypocritical, be cautious, be<br/>
Not what you seem, but always what you see.<br/>
<br/>
But how shall I relate in other cantos<br/>
    Of what befell our hero in the land,<br/>
Which &rsquo;tis the common cry and lie to vaunt as<br/>
    A moral country? But I hold my hand&mdash;<br/>
For I disdain to write an Atalantis;<br/>
    But &rsquo;tis as well at once to understand,<br/>
You are not a moral people, and you know it<br/>
Without the aid of too sincere a poet.<br/>
<br/>
What Juan saw and underwent shall be<br/>
    My topic, with of course the due restriction<br/>
Which is required by proper courtesy;<br/>
    And recollect the work is only fiction,<br/>
And that I sing of neither mine nor me,<br/>
    Though every scribe, in some slight turn of diction,<br/>
Will hint allusions never meant. Ne&rsquo;er doubt<br/>
This&mdash;when I speak, I don&rsquo;t hint, but speak out.<br/>
<br/>
Whether he married with the third or fourth<br/>
    Offspring of some sage husband-hunting countess,<br/>
Or whether with some virgin of more worth<br/>
    (I mean in Fortune&rsquo;s matrimonial bounties)<br/>
He took to regularly peopling Earth,<br/>
    Of which your lawful awful wedlock fount is,&mdash;<br/>
Or whether he was taken in for damages,<br/>
For being too excursive in his homages,&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Is yet within the unread events of time.<br/>
    Thus far, go forth, thou lay, which I will back<br/>
Against the same given quantity of rhyme,<br/>
    For being as much the subject of attack<br/>
As ever yet was any work sublime,<br/>
    By those who love to say that white is black.<br/>
So much the better!&mdash;I may stand alone,<br/>
But would not change my free thoughts for a throne.<br/>

CANTO THE TWELFTH.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
Of all the barbarous middle ages, that<br/>
    Which is most barbarous is the middle age<br/>
Of man; it is&mdash;I really scarce know what;<br/>
    But when we hover between fool and sage,<br/>
And don&rsquo;t know justly what we would be at&mdash;<br/>
    A period something like a printed page,<br/>
Black letter upon foolscap, while our hair<br/>
Grows grizzled, and we are not what we were;&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Too old for youth,&mdash;too young, at thirty-five,<br/>
    To herd with boys, or hoard with good threescore,&mdash;<br/>
I wonder people should be left alive;<br/>
    But since they are, that epoch is a bore:<br/>
Love lingers still, although &rsquo;twere late to wive;<br/>
    And as for other love, the illusion &rsquo;s o&rsquo;er;<br/>
And money, that most pure imagination,<br/>
Gleams only through the dawn of its creation.<br/>
<br/>
O Gold! Why call we misers miserable?<br/>
    Theirs is the pleasure that can never pall;<br/>
Theirs is the best bower anchor, the chain cable<br/>
    Which holds fast other pleasures great and small.<br/>
Ye who but see the saving man at table,<br/>
    And scorn his temperate board, as none at all,<br/>
And wonder how the wealthy can be sparing,<br/>
Know not what visions spring from each cheese-paring.<br/>
<br/>
Love or lust makes man sick, and wine much sicker;<br/>
    Ambition rends, and gaming gains a loss;<br/>
But making money, slowly first, then quicker,<br/>
    And adding still a little through each cross<br/>
(Which will come over things), beats love or liquor,<br/>
    The gamester&rsquo;s counter, or the statesman&rsquo;s dross.<br/>
O Gold! I still prefer thee unto paper,<br/>
Which makes bank credit like a bank of vapour.<br/>
<br/>
Who hold the balance of the world? Who reign<br/>
    O&rsquo;er congress, whether royalist or liberal?<br/>
Who rouse the shirtless patriots of Spain?<br/>
    (That make old Europe&rsquo;s journals squeak and gibber all.)<br/>
Who keep the world, both old and new, in pain<br/>
    Or pleasure? Who make politics run glibber all?<br/>
The shade of Buonaparte&rsquo;s noble daring?-<br/>
Jew Rothschild, and his fellow-Christian, Baring.<br/>
<br/>
Those, and the truly liberal Lafitte,<br/>
    Are the true lords of Europe. Every loan<br/>
Is not a merely speculative hit,<br/>
    But seats a nation or upsets a throne.<br/>
Republics also get involved a bit;<br/>
    Columbia&rsquo;s stock hath holders not unknown<br/>
On &rsquo;Change; and even thy silver soil, Peru,<br/>
Must get itself discounted by a Jew.<br/>
<br/>
Why call the miser miserable? as<br/>
    I said before: the frugal life is his,<br/>
Which in a saint or cynic ever was<br/>
    The theme of praise: a hermit would not miss<br/>
Canonization for the self-same cause,<br/>
    And wherefore blame gaunt wealth&rsquo;s austerities?<br/>
Because, you&rsquo;ll say, nought calls for such a trial;&mdash;<br/>
Then there&rsquo;s more merit in his self-denial.<br/>
<br/>
He is your only poet;&mdash;passion, pure<br/>
    And sparkling on from heap to heap, displays,<br/>
Possess&rsquo;d, the ore, of which mere hopes allure<br/>
    Nations athwart the deep: the golden rays<br/>
Flash up in ingots from the mine obscure;<br/>
    On him the diamond pours its brilliant blaze,<br/>
While the mild emerald&rsquo;s beam shades down the dies<br/>
Of other stones, to soothe the miser&rsquo;s eyes.<br/>
<br/>
The lands on either side are his; the ship<br/>
    From Ceylon, Inde, or far Cathay, unloads<br/>
For him the fragrant produce of each trip;<br/>
    Beneath his cars of Ceres groan the roads,<br/>
And the vine blushes like Aurora&rsquo;s lip;<br/>
    His very cellars might be kings&rsquo; abodes;<br/>
While he, despising every sensual call,<br/>
Commands&mdash;the intellectual lord of all.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps he hath great projects in his mind,<br/>
    To build a college, or to found a race,<br/>
A hospital, a church,&mdash;and leave behind<br/>
    Some dome surmounted by his meagre face:<br/>
Perhaps he fain would liberate mankind<br/>
    Even with the very ore which makes them base;<br/>
Perhaps he would be wealthiest of his nation,<br/>
Or revel in the joys of calculation.<br/>
<br/>
But whether all, or each, or none of these<br/>
    May be the hoarder&rsquo;s principle of action,<br/>
The fool will call such mania a disease:&mdash;<br/>
    What is his own? Go&mdash;look at each transaction,<br/>
Wars, revels, loves&mdash;do these bring men more ease<br/>
    Than the mere plodding through each &lsquo;vulgar fraction&rsquo;?<br/>
Or do they benefit mankind? Lean miser!<br/>
Let spendthrifts&rsquo; heirs enquire of yours&mdash;who &rsquo;s wiser?<br/>
<br/>
How beauteous are rouleaus! how charming chests<br/>
    Containing ingots, bags of dollars, coins<br/>
(Not of old victors, all whose heads and crests<br/>
    Weigh not the thin ore where their visage shines,<br/>
But) of fine unclipt gold, where dully rests<br/>
    Some likeness, which the glittering cirque confines,<br/>
Of modern, reigning, sterling, stupid stamp:&mdash;<br/>
Yes! ready money is Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Love rules the camp, the court, the grove,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;for love<br/>
    Is heaven, and heaven is love:&rsquo;&mdash;so sings the bard;<br/>
Which it were rather difficult to prove<br/>
    (A thing with poetry in general hard).<br/>
Perhaps there may be something in &lsquo;the grove,&rsquo;<br/>
    At least it rhymes to &lsquo;love;&rsquo; but I&rsquo;m prepared<br/>
To doubt (no less than landlords of their rental)<br/>
If &lsquo;courts&rsquo; and &lsquo;camps&rsquo; be quite so sentimental.<br/>
<br/>
But if Love don&rsquo;t, Cash does, and Cash alone:<br/>
    Cash rules the grove, and fells it too besides;<br/>
Without cash, camps were thin, and courts were none;<br/>
    Without cash, Malthus tells you&mdash;&lsquo;take no brides.&rsquo;<br/>
So Cash rules Love the ruler, on his own<br/>
    High ground, as virgin Cynthia sways the tides:<br/>
And as for Heaven &lsquo;Heaven being Love,&rsquo; why not say honey<br/>
Is wax? Heaven is not Love, &rsquo;tis Matrimony.<br/>
<br/>
Is not all love prohibited whatever,<br/>
    Excepting marriage? which is love, no doubt,<br/>
After a sort; but somehow people never<br/>
    With the same thought the two words have help&rsquo;d out:<br/>
Love may exist with marriage, and should ever,<br/>
    And marriage also may exist without;<br/>
But love sans bans is both a sin and shame,<br/>
And ought to go by quite another name.<br/>
<br/>
Now if the &lsquo;court,&rsquo; and &lsquo;camp,&rsquo; and &lsquo;grove,&rsquo; be not<br/>
    Recruited all with constant married men,<br/>
Who never coveted their neighbour&rsquo;s lot,<br/>
    I say that line &rsquo;s a lapsus of the pen;&mdash;<br/>
Strange too in my &lsquo;buon camerado&rsquo; Scott,<br/>
    So celebrated for his morals, when<br/>
My Jeffrey held him up as an example<br/>
To me;&mdash;of whom these morals are a sample.<br/>
<br/>
Well, if I don&rsquo;t succeed, I have succeeded,<br/>
    And that &rsquo;s enough; succeeded in my youth,<br/>
The only time when much success is needed:<br/>
    And my success produced what I, in sooth,<br/>
Cared most about; it need not now be pleaded&mdash;<br/>
    Whate&rsquo;er it was, &rsquo;twas mine; I&rsquo;ve paid, in truth,<br/>
Of late the penalty of such success,<br/>
But have not learn&rsquo;d to wish it any less.<br/>
<br/>
That suit in Chancery,&mdash;which some persons plead<br/>
    In an appeal to the unborn, whom they,<br/>
In the faith of their procreative creed,<br/>
    Baptize posterity, or future clay,&mdash;<br/>
To me seems but a dubious kind of reed<br/>
    To lean on for support in any way;<br/>
Since odds are that posterity will know<br/>
No more of them, than they of her, I trow.<br/>
<br/>
Why, I&rsquo;m posterity&mdash;and so are you;<br/>
    And whom do we remember? Not a hundred.<br/>
Were every memory written down all true,<br/>
    The tenth or twentieth name would be but blunder&rsquo;d;<br/>
Even Plutarch&rsquo;s Lives have but pick&rsquo;d out a few,<br/>
    And &rsquo;gainst those few your annalists have thunder&rsquo;d;<br/>
And Mitford in the nineteenth century<br/>
Gives, with Greek truth, the good old Greek the lie.<br/>
<br/>
Good people all, of every degree,<br/>
    Ye gentle readers and ungentle writers,<br/>
In this twelfth Canto &rsquo;tis my wish to be<br/>
    As serious as if I had for inditers<br/>
Malthus and Wilberforce:&mdash;the last set free<br/>
    The Negroes and is worth a million fighters;<br/>
While Wellington has but enslaved the Whites,<br/>
And Malthus does the thing &rsquo;gainst which he writes.<br/>
<br/>
I&rsquo;m serious&mdash;so are all men upon paper;<br/>
    And why should I not form my speculation,<br/>
And hold up to the sun my little taper?<br/>
    Mankind just now seem wrapt in mediation<br/>
On constitutions and steam-boats of vapour;<br/>
    While sages write against all procreation,<br/>
Unless a man can calculate his means<br/>
Of feeding brats the moment his wife weans.<br/>
<br/>
That &rsquo;s noble! That &rsquo;s romantic! For my part,<br/>
    I think that &lsquo;Philo-genitiveness&rsquo; is<br/>
(Now here&rsquo;s a word quite after my own heart,<br/>
    Though there&rsquo;s a shorter a good deal than this,<br/>
If that politeness set it not apart;<br/>
    But I&rsquo;m resolved to say nought that &rsquo;s amiss)&mdash;<br/>
I say, methinks that &lsquo;Philo-genitiveness&rsquo;<br/>
Might meet from men a little more forgiveness.<br/>
<br/>
And now to business.&mdash;O my gentle Juan,<br/>
    Thou art in London&mdash;in that pleasant place,<br/>
Where every kind of mischief &rsquo;s daily brewing,<br/>
    Which can await warm youth in its wild race.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis true, that thy career is not a new one;<br/>
    Thou art no novice in the headlong chase<br/>
Of early life; but this is a new land,<br/>
Which foreigners can never understand.<br/>
<br/>
What with a small diversity of climate,<br/>
    Of hot or cold, mercurial or sedate,<br/>
I could send forth my mandate like a primate<br/>
    Upon the rest of Europe&rsquo;s social state;<br/>
But thou art the most difficult to rhyme at,<br/>
    Great Britain, which the Muse may penetrate.<br/>
All countries have their &lsquo;Lions,&rsquo; but in the<br/>
There is but one superb menagerie.<br/>
<br/>
But I am sick of politics. Begin,<br/>
    &lsquo;Paulo Majora.&rsquo; Juan, undecided<br/>
Amongst the paths of being &lsquo;taken in,&rsquo;<br/>
    Above the ice had like a skater glided:<br/>
When tired of play, he flirted without sin<br/>
    With some of those fair creatures who have prided<br/>
Themselves on innocent tantalisation,<br/>
And hate all vice except its reputation.<br/>
<br/>
But these are few, and in the end they make<br/>
    Some devilish escapade or stir, which shows<br/>
That even the purest people may mistake<br/>
    Their way through virtue&rsquo;s primrose paths of snows;<br/>
And then men stare, as if a new ass spake<br/>
    To Balaam, and from tongue to ear o&rsquo;erflows<br/>
Quicksilver small talk, ending (if you note it)<br/>
With the kind world&rsquo;s amen&mdash;&lsquo;Who would have thought it?&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
The little Leila, with her orient eyes,<br/>
    And taciturn Asiatic disposition<br/>
(Which saw all western things with small surprise,<br/>
    To the surprise of people of condition,<br/>
Who think that novelties are butterflies<br/>
    To be pursued as food for inanition),<br/>
Her charming figure and romantic history<br/>
Became a kind of fashionable mystery.<br/>
<br/>
The women much divided&mdash;as is usual<br/>
    Amongst the sex in little things or great.<br/>
Think not, fair creatures, that I mean to abuse you all&mdash;<br/>
    I have always liked you better than I state:<br/>
Since I&rsquo;ve grown moral, still I must accuse you all<br/>
    Of being apt to talk at a great rate;<br/>
And now there was a general sensation<br/>
Amongst you, about Leila&rsquo;s education.<br/>
<br/>
In one point only were you settled&mdash;and<br/>
    You had reason; &rsquo;twas that a young child of grace,<br/>
As beautiful as her own native land,<br/>
    And far away, the last bud of her race,<br/>
Howe&rsquo;er our friend Don Juan might command<br/>
    Himself for five, four, three, or two years&rsquo; space,<br/>
Would be much better taught beneath the eye<br/>
Of peeresses whose follies had run dry.<br/>
<br/>
So first there was a generous emulation,<br/>
    And then there was a general competition,<br/>
To undertake the orphan&rsquo;s education.<br/>
    As Juan was a person of condition,<br/>
It had been an affront on this occasion<br/>
    To talk of a subscription or petition;<br/>
But sixteen dowagers, ten unwed she sages,<br/>
Whose tale belongs to &lsquo;Hallam&rsquo;s Middle Ages,&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
And one or two sad, separate wives, without<br/>
    A fruit to bloom upon their withering bough&mdash;<br/>
Begg&rsquo;d to bring up the little girl and &lsquo;out,&rsquo;-<br/>
    For that &rsquo;s the phrase that settles all things now,<br/>
Meaning a virgin&rsquo;s first blush at a rout,<br/>
    And all her points as thorough-bred to show:<br/>
And I assure you, that like virgin honey<br/>
Tastes their first season (mostly if they have money).<br/>
<br/>
How all the needy honourable misters,<br/>
    Each out-at-elbow peer, or desperate dandy,<br/>
The watchful mothers, and the careful sisters<br/>
    (Who, by the by, when clever, are more handy<br/>
At making matches, where &lsquo;&rsquo;tis gold that glisters,&rsquo;<br/>
    Than their he relatives), like flies o&rsquo;er candy<br/>
Buzz round &lsquo;the Fortune&rsquo; with their busy battery,<br/>
To turn her head with waltzing and with flattery!<br/>
<br/>
Each aunt, each cousin, hath her speculation;<br/>
    Nay, married dames will now and then discover<br/>
Such pure disinterestedness of passion,<br/>
    I&rsquo;ve known them court an heiress for their lover.<br/>
&lsquo;Tantaene!&rsquo; Such the virtues of high station,<br/>
    Even in the hopeful Isle, whose outlet &rsquo;s &lsquo;Dover!&rsquo;<br/>
While the poor rich wretch, object of these cares,<br/>
Has cause to wish her sire had had male heirs.<br/>
<br/>
Some are soon bagg&rsquo;d, and some reject three dozen.<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis fine to see them scattering refusals<br/>
And wild dismay o&rsquo;er every angry cousin<br/>
    (Friends of the party), who begin accusals,<br/>
Such as&mdash;&lsquo;Unless Miss (Blank) meant to have chosen<br/>
    Poor Frederick, why did she accord perusals<br/>
To his billets? Why waltz with him? Why, I pray,<br/>
Look yes last night, and yet say no to-day?<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Why?&mdash;Why?&mdash;Besides, Fred really was attach&rsquo;d;<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas not her fortune&mdash;he has enough without:<br/>
The time will come she&rsquo;ll wish that she had snatch&rsquo;d<br/>
    So good an opportunity, no doubt:&mdash;<br/>
But the old marchioness some plan had hatch&rsquo;d,<br/>
    As I&rsquo;ll tell Aurea at to-morrow&rsquo;s rout:<br/>
And after all poor Frederick may do better&mdash;<br/>
Pray did you see her answer to his letter?&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Smart uniforms and sparkling coronets<br/>
    Are spurn&rsquo;d in turn, until her turn arrives,<br/>
After male loss of time, and hearts, and bets<br/>
    Upon the sweepstakes for substantial wives;<br/>
And when at last the pretty creature gets<br/>
    Some gentleman, who fights, or writes, or drives,<br/>
It soothes the awkward squad of the rejected<br/>
To find how very badly she selected.<br/>
<br/>
For sometimes they accept some long pursuer,<br/>
    Worn out with importunity; or fall<br/>
(But here perhaps the instances are fewer)<br/>
    To the lot of him who scarce pursued at all.<br/>
A hazy widower turn&rsquo;d of forty &rsquo;s sure<br/>
    (If &rsquo;tis not vain examples to recall)<br/>
To draw a high prize: now, howe&rsquo;er he got her, I<br/>
See nought more strange in this than t&rsquo; other lottery.<br/>
<br/>
I, for my part (one &lsquo;modern instance&rsquo; more,<br/>
    &lsquo;True, &rsquo;tis a pity&mdash;pity &rsquo;tis, &rsquo;tis true&rsquo;),<br/>
Was chosen from out an amatory score,<br/>
    Albeit my years were less discreet than few;<br/>
But though I also had reform&rsquo;d before<br/>
    Those became one who soon were to be two,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll not gainsay the generous public&rsquo;s voice,<br/>
That the young lady made a monstrous choice.<br/>
<br/>
O, pardon my digression&mdash;or at least<br/>
    Peruse! &rsquo;Tis always with a moral end<br/>
That I dissert, like grace before a feast:<br/>
    For like an aged aunt, or tiresome friend,<br/>
A rigid guardian, or a zealous priest,<br/>
    My Muse by exhortation means to mend<br/>
All people, at all times, and in most places,<br/>
Which puts my Pegasus to these grave paces.<br/>
<br/>
But now I&rsquo;m going to be immoral; now<br/>
    I mean to show things really as they are,<br/>
Not as they ought to be: for I avow,<br/>
    That till we see what &rsquo;s what in fact, we&rsquo;re far<br/>
From much improvement with that virtuous plough<br/>
    Which skims the surface, leaving scarce a scar<br/>
Upon the black loam long manured by Vice,<br/>
Only to keep its corn at the old price.<br/>
<br/>
But first of little Leila we&rsquo;ll dispose;<br/>
    For like a day-dawn she was young and pure,<br/>
Or like the old comparison of snows,<br/>
    Which are more pure than pleasant to be sure.<br/>
Like many people everybody knows,<br/>
    Don Juan was delighted to secure<br/>
A goodly guardian for his infant charge,<br/>
Who might not profit much by being at large.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, he had found out he was no tutor<br/>
    (I wish that others would find out the same);<br/>
And rather wish&rsquo;d in such things to stand neuter,<br/>
    For silly wards will bring their guardians blame:<br/>
So when he saw each ancient dame a suitor<br/>
    To make his little wild Asiatic tame,<br/>
Consulting &lsquo;the Society for Vice<br/>
Suppression,&rsquo; Lady Pinchbeck was his choice.<br/>
<br/>
Olden she was&mdash;but had been very young;<br/>
    Virtuous she was&mdash;and had been, I believe;<br/>
Although the world has such an evil tongue<br/>
    That&mdash;but my chaster ear will not receive<br/>
An echo of a syllable that &rsquo;s wrong:<br/>
    In fact, there&rsquo;s nothing makes me so much grieve,<br/>
As that abominable tittle-tattle,<br/>
Which is the cud eschew&rsquo;d by human cattle.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover I&rsquo;ve remark&rsquo;d (and I was once<br/>
    A slight observer in a modest way),<br/>
And so may every one except a dunce,<br/>
    That ladies in their youth a little gay,<br/>
Besides their knowledge of the world, and sense<br/>
    Of the sad consequence of going astray,<br/>
Are wiser in their warnings &rsquo;gainst the woe<br/>
Which the mere passionless can never know.<br/>
<br/>
While the harsh prude indemnifies her virtue<br/>
    By railing at the unknown and envied passion,<br/>
Seeking far less to save you than to hurt you,<br/>
    Or, what &rsquo;s still worse, to put you out of fashion,&mdash;<br/>
The kinder veteran with calm words will court you,<br/>
    Entreating you to pause before you dash on;<br/>
Expounding and illustrating the riddle<br/>
Of epic Love&rsquo;s beginning, end, and middle.<br/>
<br/>
Now whether it be thus, or that they are stricter,<br/>
    As better knowing why they should be so,<br/>
I think you&rsquo;ll find from many a family picture,<br/>
    That daughters of such mothers as may know<br/>
The world by experience rather than by lecture,<br/>
    Turn out much better for the Smithfield Show<br/>
Of vestals brought into the marriage mart,<br/>
Than those bred up by prudes without a heart.<br/>
<br/>
I said that Lady Pinchbeck had been talk&rsquo;d about&mdash;<br/>
    As who has not, if female, young, and pretty?<br/>
But now no more the ghost of Scandal stalk&rsquo;d about;<br/>
    She merely was deem&rsquo;d amiable and witty,<br/>
And several of her best bon-mots were hawk&rsquo;d about:<br/>
    Then she was given to charity and pity,<br/>
And pass&rsquo;d (at least the latter years of life)<br/>
For being a most exemplary wife.<br/>
<br/>
High in high circles, gentle in her own,<br/>
    She was the mild reprover of the young,<br/>
Whenever&mdash;which means every day&mdash;they&rsquo;d shown<br/>
    An awkward inclination to go wrong.<br/>
The quantity of good she did &rsquo;s unknown,<br/>
    Or at the least would lengthen out my song:<br/>
In brief, the little orphan of the East<br/>
Had raised an interest in her, which increased.<br/>
<br/>
Juan, too, was a sort of favourite with her,<br/>
    Because she thought him a good heart at bottom,<br/>
A little spoil&rsquo;d, but not so altogether;<br/>
    Which was a wonder, if you think who got him,<br/>
And how he had been toss&rsquo;d, he scarce knew whither:<br/>
    Though this might ruin others, it did not him,<br/>
At least entirely&mdash;for he had seen too many<br/>
Changes in youth, to be surprised at any.<br/>
<br/>
And these vicissitudes tell best in youth;<br/>
    For when they happen at a riper age,<br/>
People are apt to blame the Fates, forsooth,<br/>
    And wonder Providence is not more sage.<br/>
Adversity is the first path to truth:<br/>
    He who hath proved war, storm, or woman&rsquo;s rage,<br/>
Whether his winters be eighteen or eighty,<br/>
Hath won the experience which is deem&rsquo;d so weighty.<br/>
<br/>
How far it profits is another matter.-<br/>
    Our hero gladly saw his little charge<br/>
Safe with a lady, whose last grown-up daughter<br/>
    Being long married, and thus set at large,<br/>
Had left all the accomplishments she taught her<br/>
    To be transmitted, like the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s barge,<br/>
To the next comer; or&mdash;as it will tell<br/>
More Muse-like&mdash;like to Cytherea&rsquo;s shell.<br/>
<br/>
I call such things transmission; for there is<br/>
    A floating balance of accomplishment<br/>
Which forms a pedigree from Miss to Miss,<br/>
    According as their minds or backs are bent.<br/>
Some waltz; some draw; some fathom the abyss<br/>
    Of metaphysics; others are content<br/>
With music; the most moderate shine as wits;<br/>
While others have a genius turn&rsquo;d for fits.<br/>
<br/>
But whether fits, or wits, or harpsichords,<br/>
    Theology, fine arts, or finer stays,<br/>
May be the baits for gentlemen or lords<br/>
    With regular descent, in these our days,<br/>
The last year to the new transfers its hoards;<br/>
    New vestals claim men&rsquo;s eyes with the same praise<br/>
Of &lsquo;elegant&rsquo; et caetera, in fresh batches&mdash;<br/>
All matchless creatures, and yet bent on matches.<br/>
<br/>
But now I will begin my poem. &rsquo;Tis<br/>
    Perhaps a little strange, if not quite new,<br/>
That from the first of Cantos up to this<br/>
    I&rsquo;ve not begun what we have to go through.<br/>
These first twelve books are merely flourishes,<br/>
    Preludios, trying just a string or two<br/>
Upon my lyre, or making the pegs sure;<br/>
And when so, you shall have the overture.<br/>
<br/>
My Muses do not care a pinch of rosin<br/>
    About what &rsquo;s call&rsquo;d success, or not succeeding:<br/>
Such thoughts are quite below the strain they have chosen;<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis a &lsquo;great moral lesson&rsquo; they are reading.<br/>
I thought, at setting off, about two dozen<br/>
    Cantos would do; but at Apollo&rsquo;s pleading,<br/>
If that my Pegasus should not be founder&rsquo;d,<br/>
I think to canter gently through a hundred.<br/>
<br/>
Don Juan saw that microcosm on stilts,<br/>
    Yclept the Great World; for it is the least,<br/>
Although the highest: but as swords have hilts<br/>
    By which their power of mischief is increased,<br/>
When man in battle or in quarrel tilts,<br/>
    Thus the low world, north, south, or west, or east,<br/>
Must still obey the high&mdash;which is their handle,<br/>
Their moon, their sun, their gas, their farthing candle.<br/>
<br/>
He had many friends who had many wives, and was<br/>
    Well look&rsquo;d upon by both, to that extent<br/>
Of friendship which you may accept or pass,<br/>
    It does nor good nor harm being merely meant<br/>
To keep the wheels going of the higher class,<br/>
    And draw them nightly when a ticket &rsquo;s sent:<br/>
And what with masquerades, and fetes, and balls,<br/>
For the first season such a life scarce palls.<br/>
<br/>
A young unmarried man, with a good name<br/>
    And fortune, has an awkward part to play;<br/>
For good society is but a game,<br/>
    &lsquo;The royal game of Goose,&rsquo; as I may say,<br/>
Where every body has some separate aim,<br/>
    An end to answer, or a plan to lay&mdash;<br/>
The single ladies wishing to be double,<br/>
The married ones to save the virgins trouble.<br/>
<br/>
I don&rsquo;t mean this as general, but particular<br/>
    Examples may be found of such pursuits:<br/>
Though several also keep their perpendicular<br/>
    Like poplars, with good principles for roots;<br/>
Yet many have a method more reticular&mdash;<br/>
    &lsquo;Fishers for men,&rsquo; like sirens with soft lutes:<br/>
For talk six times with the same single lady,<br/>
And you may get the wedding dresses ready.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you&rsquo;ll have a letter from the mother,<br/>
    To say her daughter&rsquo;s feelings are trepann&rsquo;d;<br/>
Perhaps you&rsquo;ll have a visit from the brother,<br/>
    All strut, and stays, and whiskers, to demand<br/>
What &lsquo;your intentions are?&rsquo;&mdash;One way or other<br/>
    It seems the virgin&rsquo;s heart expects your hand:<br/>
And between pity for her case and yours,<br/>
You&rsquo;ll add to Matrimony&rsquo;s list of cures.<br/>
<br/>
I&rsquo;ve known a dozen weddings made even thus,<br/>
    And some of them high names: I have also known<br/>
Young men who&mdash;though they hated to discuss<br/>
    Pretensions which they never dream&rsquo;d to have shown&mdash;<br/>
Yet neither frighten&rsquo;d by a female fuss,<br/>
    Nor by mustachios moved, were let alone,<br/>
And lived, as did the broken-hearted fair,<br/>
In happier plight than if they form&rsquo;d a pair.<br/>
<br/>
There&rsquo;s also nightly, to the uninitiated,<br/>
    A peril&mdash;not indeed like love or marriage,<br/>
But not the less for this to be depreciated:<br/>
    It is&mdash;I meant and mean not to disparage<br/>
The show of virtue even in the vitiated&mdash;<br/>
    It adds an outward grace unto their carriage&mdash;<br/>
But to denounce the amphibious sort of harlot,<br/>
&lsquo;Couleur de rose,&rsquo; who &rsquo;s neither white nor scarlet.<br/>
<br/>
Such is your cold coquette, who can&rsquo;t say &lsquo;No,&rsquo;<br/>
    And won&rsquo;t say &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and keeps you on and off-ing<br/>
On a lee-shore, till it begins to blow&mdash;<br/>
    Then sees your heart wreck&rsquo;d, with an inward scoffing.<br/>
This works a world of sentimental woe,<br/>
    And sends new Werters yearly to their coffin;<br/>
But yet is merely innocent flirtation,<br/>
Not quite adultery, but adulteration.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Ye gods, I grow a talker!&rsquo; Let us prate.<br/>
    The next of perils, though I place it sternest,<br/>
Is when, without regard to &lsquo;church or state,&rsquo;<br/>
    A wife makes or takes love in upright earnest.<br/>
Abroad, such things decide few women&rsquo;s fate&mdash;<br/>
    (Such, early traveller! is the truth thou learnest)&mdash;<br/>
But in old England, when a young bride errs,<br/>
Poor thing! Eve&rsquo;s was a trifling case to hers.<br/>
<br/>
For &rsquo;tis a low, newspaper, humdrum, lawsuit<br/>
    Country, where a young couple of the same ages<br/>
Can&rsquo;t form a friendship, but the world o&rsquo;erawes it.<br/>
    Then there&rsquo;s the vulgar trick of those d&mdash;d damages! !<br/>
A verdict&mdash;grievous foe to those who cause it!-<br/>
    Forms a sad climax to romantic homages;<br/>
Besides those soothing speeches of the pleaders,<br/>
And evidences which regale all readers.<br/>
<br/>
But they who blunder thus are raw beginners;<br/>
    A little genial sprinkling of hypocrisy<br/>
Has saved the fame of thousand splendid sinners,<br/>
    The loveliest oligarchs of our gynocracy;<br/>
You may see such at all the balls and dinners,<br/>
    Among the proudest of our aristocracy,<br/>
So gentle, charming, charitable, chaste&mdash;<br/>
And all by having tact as well as taste.<br/>
<br/>
Juan, who did not stand in the predicament<br/>
    Of a mere novice, had one safeguard more;<br/>
For he was sick&mdash;no, &rsquo;twas not the word sick I meant&mdash;<br/>
    But he had seen so much love before,<br/>
That he was not in heart so very weak;&mdash;I meant<br/>
    But thus much, and no sneer against the shore<br/>
Of white cliffs, white necks, blue eyes, bluer stockings,<br/>
Tithes, taxes, duns, and doors with double knockings.<br/>
<br/>
But coming young from lands and scenes romantic,<br/>
    Where lives, not lawsuits, must be risk&rsquo;d for Passion,<br/>
And Passion&rsquo;s self must have a spice of frantic,<br/>
    Into a country where &rsquo;tis half a fashion,<br/>
Seem&rsquo;d to him half commercial, half pedantic,<br/>
    Howe&rsquo;er he might esteem this moral nation:<br/>
Besides (alas! his taste&mdash;forgive and pity!)<br/>
At first he did not think the women pretty.<br/>
<br/>
I say at first&mdash;for he found out at last,<br/>
    But by degrees, that they were fairer far<br/>
Than the more glowing dames whose lot is cast<br/>
    Beneath the influence of the eastern star.<br/>
A further proof we should not judge in haste;<br/>
    Yet inexperience could not be his bar<br/>
To taste:&mdash;the truth is, if men would confess,<br/>
That novelties please less than they impress.<br/>
<br/>
Though travell&rsquo;d, I have never had the luck to<br/>
    Trace up those shuffling negroes, Nile or Niger,<br/>
To that impracticable place, Timbuctoo,<br/>
    Where Geography finds no one to oblige her<br/>
With such a chart as may be safely stuck to&mdash;<br/>
    For Europe ploughs in Afric like &lsquo;bos piger:&rsquo;<br/>
But if I had been at Timbuctoo, there<br/>
No doubt I should be told that black is fair.<br/>
<br/>
It is. I will not swear that black is white;<br/>
    But I suspect in fact that white is black,<br/>
And the whole matter rests upon eyesight.<br/>
    Ask a blind man, the best judge. You&rsquo;ll attack<br/>
Perhaps this new position&mdash;but I&rsquo;m right;<br/>
    Or if I&rsquo;m wrong, I&rsquo;ll not be ta&rsquo;en aback:&mdash;<br/>
He hath no morn nor night, but all is dark<br/>
Within; and what seest thou? A dubious spark.<br/>
<br/>
But I&rsquo;m relapsing into metaphysics,<br/>
    That labyrinth, whose clue is of the same<br/>
Construction as your cures for hectic phthisics,<br/>
    Those bright moths fluttering round a dying flame;<br/>
And this reflection brings me to plain physics,<br/>
    And to the beauties of a foreign dame,<br/>
Compared with those of our pure pearls of price,<br/>
Those polar summers, all sun, and some ice.<br/>
<br/>
Or say they are like virtuous mermaids, whose<br/>
    Beginnings are fair faces, ends mere fishes;&mdash;<br/>
Not that there&rsquo;s not a quantity of those<br/>
    Who have a due respect for their own wishes.<br/>
Like Russians rushing from hot baths to snows<br/>
    Are they, at bottom virtuous even when vicious:<br/>
They warm into a scrape, but keep of course,<br/>
As a reserve, a plunge into remorse.<br/>
<br/>
But this has nought to do with their outsides.<br/>
    I said that Juan did not think them pretty<br/>
At the first blush; for a fair Briton hides<br/>
    Half her attractions&mdash;probably from pity&mdash;<br/>
And rather calmly into the heart glides,<br/>
    Than storms it as a foe would take a city;<br/>
But once there (if you doubt this, prithee try)<br/>
She keeps it for you like a true ally.<br/>
<br/>
She cannot step as does an Arab barb,<br/>
    Or Andalusian girl from mass returning,<br/>
Nor wear as gracefully as Gauls her garb,<br/>
    Nor in her eye Ausonia&rsquo;s glance is burning;<br/>
Her voice, though sweet, is not so fit to warb&mdash;<br/>
    le those bravuras (which I still am learning<br/>
To like, though I have been seven years in Italy,<br/>
And have, or had, an ear that served me prettily);&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
She cannot do these things, nor one or two<br/>
    Others, in that off-hand and dashing style<br/>
Which takes so much&mdash;to give the devil his due;<br/>
    Nor is she quite so ready with her smile,<br/>
Nor settles all things in one interview<br/>
    (A thing approved as saving time and toil);&mdash;<br/>
But though the soil may give you time and trouble,<br/>
Well cultivated, it will render double.<br/>
<br/>
And if in fact she takes to a &lsquo;grande passion,&rsquo;<br/>
    It is a very serious thing indeed:<br/>
Nine times in ten &rsquo;tis but caprice or fashion,<br/>
    Coquetry, or a wish to take the lead,<br/>
The pride of a mere child with a new sash on,<br/>
    Or wish to make a rival&rsquo;s bosom bleed:<br/>
But the tenth instance will be a tornado,<br/>
For there&rsquo;s no saying what they will or may do.<br/>
<br/>
The reason &rsquo;s obvious; if there&rsquo;s an eclat,<br/>
    They lose their caste at once, as do the Parias;<br/>
And when the delicacies of the law<br/>
    Have fill&rsquo;d their papers with their comments various,<br/>
Society, that china without flaw<br/>
    (The hypocrite!), will banish them like Marius,<br/>
To sit amidst the ruins of their guilt:<br/>
For Fame &rsquo;s a Carthage not so soon rebuilt.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this is as it should be;&mdash;it is<br/>
    A comment on the Gospel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sin no more,<br/>
And be thy sins forgiven:&rsquo;&mdash;but upon this<br/>
    I leave the saints to settle their own score.<br/>
Abroad, though doubtless they do much amiss,<br/>
    An erring woman finds an opener door<br/>
For her return to Virtue&mdash;as they cal<br/>
That lady, who should be at home to all.<br/>
<br/>
For me, I leave the matter where I find it,<br/>
    Knowing that such uneasy virtue leads<br/>
People some ten times less in fact to mind it,<br/>
    And care but for discoveries and not deeds.<br/>
And as for chastity, you&rsquo;ll never bind it<br/>
    By all the laws the strictest lawyer pleads,<br/>
But aggravate the crime you have not prevented,<br/>
By rendering desperate those who had else repented.<br/>
<br/>
But Juan was no casuist, nor had ponder&rsquo;d<br/>
    Upon the moral lessons of mankind:<br/>
Besides, he had not seen of several hundred<br/>
    A lady altogether to his mind.<br/>
A little &lsquo;blase&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;tis not to be wonder&rsquo;d<br/>
    At, that his heart had got a tougher rind:<br/>
And though not vainer from his past success,<br/>
No doubt his sensibilities were less.<br/>
<br/>
He also had been busy seeing sights&mdash;<br/>
    The Parliament and all the other houses;<br/>
Had sat beneath the gallery at nights,<br/>
    To hear debates whose thunder roused (not rouses)<br/>
The world to gaze upon those northern lights<br/>
    Which flash&rsquo;d as far as where the musk-bull browses;<br/>
He had also stood at times behind the throne&mdash;<br/>
But Grey was not arrived, and Chatham gone.<br/>
<br/>
He saw, however, at the closing session,<br/>
    That noble sight, when really free the nation,<br/>
A king in constitutional possession<br/>
    Of such a throne as is the proudest station,<br/>
Though despots know it not&mdash;till the progression<br/>
    Of freedom shall complete their education.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis not mere splendour makes the show august<br/>
To eye or heart&mdash;it is the people&rsquo;s trust.<br/>
<br/>
There, too, he saw (whate&rsquo;er he may be now)<br/>
    A Prince, the prince of princes at the time,<br/>
With fascination in his very bow,<br/>
    And full of promise, as the spring of prime.<br/>
Though royalty was written on his brow,<br/>
    He had then the grace, too, rare in every clime,<br/>
Of being, without alloy of fop or beau,<br/>
A finish&rsquo;d gentleman from top to toe.<br/>
<br/>
And Juan was received, as hath been said,<br/>
    Into the best society: and there<br/>
Occurr&rsquo;d what often happens, I&rsquo;m afraid,<br/>
    However disciplined and debonnaire:&mdash;<br/>
The talent and good humour he display&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Besides the mark&rsquo;d distinction of his air,<br/>
Exposed him, as was natural, to temptation,<br/>
Even though himself avoided the occasion.<br/>
<br/>
But what, and where, with whom, and when, and why,<br/>
    Is not to be put hastily together;<br/>
And as my object is morality<br/>
    (Whatever people say), I don&rsquo;t know whether<br/>
I&rsquo;ll leave a single reader&rsquo;s eyelid dry,<br/>
    But harrow up his feelings till they wither,<br/>
And hew out a huge monument of pathos,<br/>
As Philip&rsquo;s son proposed to do with Athos.<br/>
<br/>
Here the twelfth Canto of our introduction<br/>
    Ends. When the body of the book &rsquo;s begun,<br/>
You&rsquo;ll find it of a different construction<br/>
    From what some people say &rsquo;twill be when done:<br/>
The plan at present &rsquo;s simply in concoction,<br/>
    I can&rsquo;t oblige you, reader, to read on;<br/>
That &rsquo;s your affair, not mine: a real spirit<br/>
Should neither court neglect, nor dread to bear it.<br/>
<br/>
And if my thunderbolt not always rattles,<br/>
    Remember, reader! you have had before<br/>
The worst of tempests and the best of battles<br/>
    That e&rsquo;er were brew&rsquo;d from elements or gore,<br/>
Besides the most sublime of&mdash;Heaven knows what else:<br/>
    An usurer could scarce expect much more&mdash;<br/>
But my best canto, save one on astronomy,<br/>
Will turn upon &lsquo;political economy.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
That is your present theme for popularity:<br/>
    Now that the public hedge hath scarce a stake,<br/>
It grows an act of patriotic charity,<br/>
    To show the people the best way to break.<br/>
My plan (but I, if but for singularity,<br/>
    Reserve it) will be very sure to take.<br/>
Meantime, read all the national debt-sinkers,<br/>
And tell me what you think of your great thinkers.<br/>

CANTO THE THIRTEENTH.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
I now mean to be serious;&mdash;it is time,<br/>
    Since laughter now-a-days is deem&rsquo;d too serious.<br/>
A jest at Vice by Virtue &rsquo;s call&rsquo;d a crime,<br/>
    And critically held as deleterious:<br/>
Besides, the sad &rsquo;s a source of the sublime,<br/>
    Although when long a little apt to weary us;<br/>
And therefore shall my lay soar high and solemn,<br/>
As an old temple dwindled to a column.<br/>
<br/>
The Lady Adeline Amundeville<br/>
    (&rsquo;Tis an old Norman name, and to be found<br/>
In pedigrees, by those who wander still<br/>
    Along the last fields of that Gothic ground)<br/>
Was high-born, wealthy by her father&rsquo;s will,<br/>
    And beauteous, even where beauties most abound,<br/>
In Britain&mdash;which of course true patriots find<br/>
The goodliest soil of body and of mind.<br/>
<br/>
I&rsquo;ll not gainsay them; it is not my cue;<br/>
    I&rsquo;ll leave them to their taste, no doubt the best:<br/>
An eye &rsquo;s an eye, and whether black or blue,<br/>
    Is no great matter, so &rsquo;tis in request,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis nonsense to dispute about a hue&mdash;<br/>
    The kindest may be taken as a test.<br/>
The fair sex should be always fair; and no man,<br/>
Till thirty, should perceive there&rsquo;s a plain woman.<br/>
<br/>
And after that serene and somewhat dull<br/>
    Epoch, that awkward corner turn&rsquo;d for days<br/>
More quiet, when our moon &rsquo;s no more at full,<br/>
    We may presume to criticise or praise;<br/>
Because indifference begins to lull<br/>
    Our passions, and we walk in wisdom&rsquo;s ways;<br/>
Also because the figure and the face<br/>
Hint, that &rsquo;tis time to give the younger place.<br/>
<br/>
I know that some would fain postpone this era,<br/>
    Reluctant as all placemen to resign<br/>
Their post; but theirs is merely a chimera,<br/>
    For they have pass&rsquo;d life&rsquo;s equinoctial line:<br/>
But then they have their claret and Madeira<br/>
    To irrigate the dryness of decline;<br/>
And county meetings, and the parliament,<br/>
And debt, and what not, for their solace sent.<br/>
<br/>
And is there not religion, and reform,<br/>
    Peace, war, the taxes, and what &rsquo;s call&rsquo;d the &lsquo;Nation&rsquo;?<br/>
The struggle to be pilots in a storm?<br/>
    The landed and the monied speculation?<br/>
The joys of mutual hate to keep them warm,<br/>
    Instead of love, that mere hallucination?<br/>
Now hatred is by far the longest pleasure;<br/>
Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure.<br/>
<br/>
Rough Johnson, the great moralist, profess&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Right honestly, &lsquo;he liked an honest hater!&rsquo;-<br/>
The only truth that yet has been confest<br/>
    Within these latest thousand years or later.<br/>
Perhaps the fine old fellow spoke in jest:&mdash;<br/>
    For my part, I am but a mere spectator,<br/>
And gaze where&rsquo;er the palace or the hovel is,<br/>
Much in the mode of Goethe&rsquo;s Mephistopheles;<br/>
<br/>
But neither love nor hate in much excess;<br/>
    Though &rsquo;twas not once so. If I sneer sometimes,<br/>
It is because I cannot well do less,<br/>
    And now and then it also suits my rhymes.<br/>
I should be very willing to redress<br/>
    Men&rsquo;s wrongs, and rather check than punish crimes,<br/>
Had not Cervantes, in that too true tale<br/>
Of Quixote, shown how all such efforts fail.<br/>
<br/>
Of all tales &rsquo;tis the saddest&mdash;and more sad,<br/>
    Because it makes us smile: his hero &rsquo;s right,<br/>
And still pursues the right;&mdash;to curb the bad<br/>
    His only object, and &rsquo;gainst odds to fight<br/>
His guerdon: &rsquo;tis his virtue makes him mad!<br/>
    But his adventures form a sorry sight;<br/>
A sorrier still is the great moral taught<br/>
By that real epic unto all who have thought.<br/>
<br/>
Redressing injury, revenging wrong,<br/>
    To aid the damsel and destroy the caitiff;<br/>
Opposing singly the united strong,<br/>
    From foreign yoke to free the helpless native:&mdash;<br/>
Alas! must noblest views, like an old song,<br/>
    Be for mere fancy&rsquo;s sport a theme creative,<br/>
A jest, a riddle, Fame through thin and thick sought!<br/>
And Socrates himself but Wisdom&rsquo;s Quixote?<br/>
<br/>
Cervantes smiled Spain&rsquo;s chivalry away;<br/>
    A single laugh demolish&rsquo;d the right arm<br/>
Of his own country;&mdash;seldom since that day<br/>
    Has Spain had heroes. While Romance could charm,<br/>
The world gave ground before her bright array;<br/>
    And therefore have his volumes done such harm,<br/>
That all their glory, as a composition,<br/>
Was dearly purchased by his land&rsquo;s perdition.<br/>
<br/>
I&rsquo;m &lsquo;at my old lunes&rsquo;&mdash;digression, and forget<br/>
    The Lady Adeline Amundeville;<br/>
The fair most fatal Juan ever met,<br/>
    Although she was not evil nor meant ill;<br/>
But Destiny and Passion spread the net<br/>
    (Fate is a good excuse for our own will),<br/>
And caught them;&mdash;what do they not catch, methinks?<br/>
But I&rsquo;m not OEdipus, and life &rsquo;s a Sphinx.<br/>
<br/>
I tell the tale as it is told, nor dare<br/>
    To venture a solution: &lsquo;Davus sum!&rsquo;<br/>
And now I will proceed upon the pair.<br/>
    Sweet Adeline, amidst the gay world&rsquo;s hum,<br/>
Was the Queen-Bee, the glass of all that &rsquo;s fair;<br/>
    Whose charms made all men speak, and women dumb.<br/>
The last &rsquo;s a miracle, and such was reckon&rsquo;d,<br/>
And since that time there has not been a second.<br/>
<br/>
Chaste was she, to detraction&rsquo;s desperation,<br/>
    And wedded unto one she had loved well&mdash;<br/>
A man known in the councils of the nation,<br/>
    Cool, and quite English, imperturbable,<br/>
Though apt to act with fire upon occasion,<br/>
    Proud of himself and her: the world could tell<br/>
Nought against either, and both seem&rsquo;d secure&mdash;<br/>
She in her virtue, he in his hauteur.<br/>
<br/>
It chanced some diplomatical relations,<br/>
    Arising out of business, often brought<br/>
Himself and Juan in their mutual stations<br/>
    Into close contact. Though reserved, nor caught<br/>
By specious seeming, Juan&rsquo;s youth, and patience,<br/>
    And talent, on his haughty spirit wrought,<br/>
And form&rsquo;d a basis of esteem, which ends<br/>
In making men what courtesy calls friends.<br/>
<br/>
And thus Lord Henry, who was cautious as<br/>
    Reserve and pride could make him, and full slow<br/>
In judging men&mdash;when once his judgment was<br/>
    Determined, right or wrong, on friend or foe,<br/>
Had all the pertinacity pride has,<br/>
    Which knows no ebb to its imperious flow,<br/>
And loves or hates, disdaining to be guided,<br/>
Because its own good pleasure hath decided.<br/>
<br/>
His friendships, therefore, and no less aversions,<br/>
    Though oft well founded, which confirm&rsquo;d but more<br/>
His prepossessions, like the laws of Persians<br/>
    And Medes, would ne&rsquo;er revoke what went before.<br/>
His feelings had not those strange fits, like tertians,<br/>
    Of common likings, which make some deplore<br/>
What they should laugh at&mdash;the mere ague still<br/>
Of men&rsquo;s regard, the fever or the chill.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis not in mortals to command success:<br/>
    But do you more, Sempronius&mdash;don&rsquo;t deserve it,&rsquo;<br/>
And take my word, you won&rsquo;t have any less.<br/>
    Be wary, watch the time, and always serve it;<br/>
Give gently way, when there&rsquo;s too great a press;<br/>
    And for your conscience, only learn to nerve it,<br/>
For, like a racer, or a boxer training,<br/>
&rsquo;Twill make, if proved, vast efforts without paining.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Henry also liked to be superior,<br/>
    As most men do, the little or the great;<br/>
The very lowest find out an inferior,<br/>
    At least they think so, to exert their state<br/>
Upon: for there are very few things wearier<br/>
    Than solitary Pride&rsquo;s oppressive weight,<br/>
Which mortals generously would divide,<br/>
By bidding others carry while they ride.<br/>
<br/>
In birth, in rank, in fortune likewise equal,<br/>
    O&rsquo;er Juan he could no distinction claim;<br/>
In years he had the advantage of time&rsquo;s sequel;<br/>
    And, as he thought, in country much the same&mdash;<br/>
Because bold Britons have a tongue and free quill,<br/>
    At which all modern nations vainly aim;<br/>
And the Lord Henry was a great debater,<br/>
So that few members kept the house up later.<br/>
<br/>
These were advantages: and then he thought&mdash;<br/>
    It was his foible, but by no means sinister&mdash;<br/>
That few or none more than himself had caught<br/>
    Court mysteries, having been himself a minister:<br/>
He liked to teach that which he had been taught,<br/>
    And greatly shone whenever there had been a stir;<br/>
And reconciled all qualities which grace man,<br/>
Always a patriot, and sometimes a placeman.<br/>
<br/>
He liked the gentle Spaniard for his gravity;<br/>
    He almost honour&rsquo;d him for his docility;<br/>
Because, though young, he acquiesced with suavity,<br/>
    Or contradicted but with proud humility.<br/>
He knew the world, and would not see depravity<br/>
    In faults which sometimes show the soil&rsquo;s fertility,<br/>
If that the weeds o&rsquo;erlive not the first crop&mdash;<br/>
For then they are very difficult to stop.<br/>
<br/>
And then he talk&rsquo;d with him about Madrid,<br/>
    Constantinople, and such distant places;<br/>
Where people always did as they were bid,<br/>
    Or did what they should not with foreign graces.<br/>
Of coursers also spake they: Henry rid<br/>
    Well, like most Englishmen, and loved the races;<br/>
And Juan, like a true-born Andalusian,<br/>
Could back a horse, as despots ride a Russian.<br/>
<br/>
And thus acquaintance grew, at noble routs,<br/>
    And diplomatic dinners, or at other&mdash;<br/>
For Juan stood well both with Ins and Outs,<br/>
    As in freemasonry a higher brother.<br/>
Upon his talent Henry had no doubts;<br/>
    His manner show&rsquo;d him sprung from a high mother;<br/>
And all men like to show their hospitality<br/>
To him whose breeding matches with his quality.<br/>
<br/>
At Blank-Blank Square;&mdash;for we will break no squares<br/>
    By naming streets: since men are so censorious,<br/>
And apt to sow an author&rsquo;s wheat with tares,<br/>
    Reaping allusions private and inglorious,<br/>
Where none were dreamt of, unto love&rsquo;s affairs,<br/>
    Which were, or are, or are to be notorious,<br/>
That therefore do I previously declare,<br/>
Lord Henry&rsquo;s mansion was in Blank-Blank Square.<br/>
<br/>
Also there bin another pious reason<br/>
    For making squares and streets anonymous;<br/>
Which is, that there is scarce a single season<br/>
    Which doth not shake some very splendid house<br/>
With some slight heart-quake of domestic treason&mdash;<br/>
    A topic scandal doth delight to rouse:<br/>
Such I might stumble over unawares,<br/>
Unless I knew the very chastest squares.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis true, I might have chosen Piccadilly,<br/>
    A place where peccadillos are unknown;<br/>
But I have motives, whether wise or silly,<br/>
    For letting that pure sanctuary alone.<br/>
Therefore I name not square, street, place, until I<br/>
    Find one where nothing naughty can be shown,<br/>
A vestal shrine of innocence of heart:<br/>
    Such are&mdash;but I have lost the London Chart.<br/>
<br/>
At Henry&rsquo;s mansion then, in Blank-Blank Square,<br/>
    Was Juan a recherche, welcome guest,<br/>
As many other noble scions were;<br/>
    And some who had but talent for their crest;<br/>
Or wealth, which is a passport every where;<br/>
    Or even mere fashion, which indeed &rsquo;s the best<br/>
Recommendation; and to be well drest<br/>
Will very often supersede the rest.<br/>
<br/>
And since &lsquo;there&rsquo;s safety in a multitude<br/>
    Of counsellors,&rsquo; as Solomon has said,<br/>
Or some one for him, in some sage, grave mood;&mdash;<br/>
    Indeed we see the daily proof display&rsquo;d<br/>
In senates, at the bar, in wordy feud,<br/>
    Where&rsquo;er collective wisdom can parade,<br/>
Which is the only cause that we can guess<br/>
Of Britain&rsquo;s present wealth and happiness;&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
But as &lsquo;there&rsquo;s safety&rsquo; grafted in the number<br/>
    &lsquo;Of counsellors&rsquo; for men, thus for the sex<br/>
A large acquaintance lets not Virtue slumber;<br/>
    Or should it shake, the choice will more perplex&mdash;<br/>
Variety itself will more encumber.<br/>
    &rsquo;Midst many rocks we guard more against wrecks;<br/>
And thus with women: howsoe&rsquo;er it shocks some&rsquo;s<br/>
Self-love, there&rsquo;s safety in a crowd of coxcombs.<br/>
<br/>
But Adeline had not the least occasion<br/>
    For such a shield, which leaves but little merit<br/>
To virtue proper, or good education.<br/>
    Her chief resource was in her own high spirit,<br/>
Which judged mankind at their due estimation;<br/>
    And for coquetry, she disdain&rsquo;d to wear it:<br/>
Secure of admiration, its impression<br/>
Was faint, as of an every-day possession.<br/>
<br/>
To all she was polite without parade;<br/>
    To some she show&rsquo;d attention of that kind<br/>
Which flatters, but is flattery convey&rsquo;d<br/>
    In such a sort as cannot leave behind<br/>
A trace unworthy either wife or maid;&mdash;<br/>
    A gentle, genial courtesy of mind,<br/>
To those who were, or pass&rsquo;d for meritorious,<br/>
Just to console sad glory for being glorious;<br/>
<br/>
Which is in all respects, save now and then,<br/>
    A dull and desolate appendage. Gaze<br/>
Upon the shades of those distinguish&rsquo;d men<br/>
    Who were or are the puppet-shows of praise,<br/>
The praise of persecution; gaze again<br/>
    On the most favour&rsquo;d; and amidst the blaze<br/>
Of sunset halos o&rsquo;er the laurel-brow&rsquo;d,<br/>
What can ye recognise?&mdash;a gilded cloud.<br/>
<br/>
There also was of course in Adeline<br/>
    That calm patrician polish in the address,<br/>
Which ne&rsquo;er can pass the equinoctial line<br/>
    Of any thing which nature would express;<br/>
Just as a mandarin finds nothing fine,&mdash;<br/>
    At least his manner suffers not to guess<br/>
That any thing he views can greatly please.<br/>
Perhaps we have borrow&rsquo;d this from the Chinese&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps from Horace: his &lsquo;Nil admirari&rsquo;<br/>
    Was what he call&rsquo;d the &lsquo;Art of Happiness;&rsquo;<br/>
An art on which the artists greatly vary,<br/>
    And have not yet attain&rsquo;d to much success.<br/>
However, &rsquo;tis expedient to be wary:<br/>
    Indifference certes don&rsquo;t produce distress;<br/>
And rash enthusiasm in good society<br/>
Were nothing but a moral inebriety.<br/>
<br/>
But Adeline was not indifferent: for<br/>
    (Now for a common-place!) beneath the snow,<br/>
As a volcano holds the lava more<br/>
    Within&mdash;et caetera. Shall I go on?&mdash;No!<br/>
I hate to hunt down a tired metaphor,<br/>
    So let the often-used volcano go.<br/>
Poor thing! How frequently, by me and others,<br/>
It hath been stirr&rsquo;d up till its smoke quite smothers!<br/>
<br/>
I&rsquo;ll have another figure in a trice:&mdash;<br/>
    What say you to a bottle of champagne?<br/>
Frozen into a very vinous ice,<br/>
    Which leaves few drops of that immortal rain,<br/>
Yet in the very centre, past all price,<br/>
    About a liquid glassful will remain;<br/>
And this is stronger than the strongest grape<br/>
Could e&rsquo;er express in its expanded shape:<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis the whole spirit brought to a quintessence;<br/>
    And thus the chilliest aspects may concentre<br/>
A hidden nectar under a cold presence.<br/>
    And such are many&mdash;though I only meant her<br/>
From whom I now deduce these moral lessons,<br/>
    On which the Muse has always sought to enter.<br/>
And your cold people are beyond all price,<br/>
When once you have broken their confounded ice.<br/>
<br/>
But after all they are a North-West Passage<br/>
    Unto the glowing India of the soul;<br/>
And as the good ships sent upon that message<br/>
    Have not exactly ascertain&rsquo;d the Pole<br/>
(Though Parry&rsquo;s efforts look a lucky presage),<br/>
    Thus gentlemen may run upon a shoal;<br/>
For if the Pole &rsquo;s not open, but all frost<br/>
(A chance still), &rsquo;tis a voyage or vessel lost.<br/>
<br/>
And young beginners may as well commence<br/>
    With quiet cruising o&rsquo;er the ocean woman;<br/>
While those who are not beginners should have sense<br/>
    Enough to make for port, ere time shall summon<br/>
With his grey signal-flag; and the past tense,<br/>
    The dreary &lsquo;Fuimus&rsquo; of all things human,<br/>
Must be declined, while life&rsquo;s thin thread &rsquo;s spun out<br/>
Between the gaping heir and gnawing gout.<br/>
<br/>
But heaven must be diverted; its diversion<br/>
    Is sometimes truculent&mdash;but never mind:<br/>
The world upon the whole is worth the assertion<br/>
    (If but for comfort) that all things are kind:<br/>
And that same devilish doctrine of the Persian,<br/>
    Of the two principles, but leaves behind<br/>
As many doubts as any other doctrine<br/>
Has ever puzzled Faith withal, or yoked her in.<br/>
<br/>
The English winter&mdash;ending in July,<br/>
    To recommence in August&mdash;now was done.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis the postilion&rsquo;s paradise: wheels fly;<br/>
    On roads, east, south, north, west, there is a run.<br/>
But for post-horses who finds sympathy?<br/>
    Man&rsquo;s pity &rsquo;s for himself, or for his son,<br/>
Always premising that said son at college<br/>
Has not contracted much more debt than knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
The London winter &rsquo;s ended in July&mdash;<br/>
    Sometimes a little later. I don&rsquo;t err<br/>
In this: whatever other blunders lie<br/>
    Upon my shoulders, here I must aver<br/>
My Muse a glass of weatherology;<br/>
    For parliament is our barometer:<br/>
Let radicals its other acts attack,<br/>
Its sessions form our only almanack.<br/>
<br/>
When its quicksilver &rsquo;s down at zero,&mdash;lo<br/>
    Coach, chariot, luggage, baggage, equipage!<br/>
Wheels whirl from Carlton palace to Soho,<br/>
    And happiest they who horses can engage;<br/>
The turnpikes glow with dust; and Rotten Row<br/>
    Sleeps from the chivalry of this bright age;<br/>
And tradesmen, with long bills and longer faces,<br/>
Sigh&mdash;as the postboys fasten on the traces.<br/>
<br/>
They and their bills, &lsquo;Arcadians both,&rsquo; are left<br/>
    To the Greek kalends of another session.<br/>
Alas! to them of ready cash bereft,<br/>
    What hope remains? Of hope the full possession,<br/>
Or generous draft, conceded as a gift,<br/>
    At a long date&mdash;till they can get a fresh one&mdash;<br/>
Hawk&rsquo;d about at a discount, small or large;<br/>
Also the solace of an overcharge.<br/>
<br/>
But these are trifles. Downward flies my lord,<br/>
    Nodding beside my lady in his carriage.<br/>
Away! away! &lsquo;Fresh horses!&rsquo; are the word,<br/>
    And changed as quickly as hearts after marriage;<br/>
The obsequious landlord hath the change restored;<br/>
    The postboys have no reason to disparage<br/>
Their fee; but ere the water&rsquo;d wheels may hiss hence,<br/>
The ostler pleads too for a reminiscence.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis granted; and the valet mounts the dickey&mdash;<br/>
    That gentleman of lords and gentlemen;<br/>
Also my lady&rsquo;s gentlewoman, tricky,<br/>
    Trick&rsquo;d out, but modest more than poet&rsquo;s pen<br/>
Can paint,&mdash;&lsquo;Cosi viaggino i Ricchi!&rsquo;<br/>
    (Excuse a foreign slipslop now and then,<br/>
If but to show I&rsquo;ve travell&rsquo;d; and what &rsquo;s travel,<br/>
Unless it teaches one to quote and cavil?)<br/>
<br/>
The London winter and the country summer<br/>
    Were well nigh over. &rsquo;Tis perhaps a pity,<br/>
When nature wears the gown that doth become her,<br/>
    To lose those best months in a sweaty city,<br/>
And wait until the nightingale grows dumber,<br/>
    Listening debates not very wise or witty,<br/>
Ere patriots their true country can remember;&mdash;<br/>
But there&rsquo;s no shooting (save grouse) till September.<br/>
<br/>
I&rsquo;ve done with my tirade. The world was gone;<br/>
    The twice two thousand, for whom earth was made,<br/>
Were vanish&rsquo;d to be what they call alone&mdash;<br/>
    That is, with thirty servants for parade,<br/>
As many guests, or more; before whom groan<br/>
    As many covers, duly, daily, laid.<br/>
Let none accuse Old England&rsquo;s hospitality&mdash;<br/>
Its quantity is but condensed to quality.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Henry and the Lady Adeline<br/>
    Departed like the rest of their compeers,<br/>
The peerage, to a mansion very fine;<br/>
    The Gothic Babel of a thousand years.<br/>
None than themselves could boast a longer line,<br/>
    Where time through heroes and through beauties steers;<br/>
And oaks as olden as their pedigree<br/>
Told of their sires, a tomb in every tree.<br/>
<br/>
A paragraph in every paper told<br/>
    Of their departure: such is modern fame:<br/>
&rsquo;Tis pity that it takes no farther hold<br/>
    Than an advertisement, or much the same;<br/>
When, ere the ink be dry, the sound grows cold.<br/>
    The Morning Post was foremost to proclaim&mdash;<br/>
&lsquo;Departure, for his country seat, to-day,<br/>
Lord H. Amundeville and Lady A.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;We understand the splendid host intends<br/>
    To entertain, this autumn, a select<br/>
And numerous party of his noble friends;<br/>
    &rsquo;Midst whom we have heard, from sources quite correct,<br/>
    With many more by rank and fashion deck&rsquo;d;<br/>
Also a foreigner of high condition,<br/>
The envoy of the secret Russian mission.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
And thus we see&mdash;who doubts the Morning Post?<br/>
    (Whose articles are like the &lsquo;Thirty-nine,&rsquo;<br/>
Which those most swear to who believe them most)&mdash;<br/>
    Our gay Russ Spaniard was ordain&rsquo;d to shine,<br/>
Deck&rsquo;d by the rays reflected from his host,<br/>
    With those who, Pope says, &lsquo;greatly daring dine.&rsquo;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis odd, but true,&mdash;last war the News abounded<br/>
More with these dinners than the kill&rsquo;d or wounded;&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
As thus: &lsquo;On Thursday there was a grand dinner;<br/>
    Present, Lords A. B. C.&rsquo;&mdash;Earls, dukes, by name<br/>
Announced with no less pomp than victory&rsquo;s winner:<br/>
    Then underneath, and in the very same<br/>
Column; date, &lsquo;Falmouth. There has lately been here<br/>
    The Slap-dash regiment, so well known to fame,<br/>
Whose loss in the late action we regret:<br/>
The vacancies are fill&rsquo;d up&mdash;see Gazette.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
To Norman Abbey whirl&rsquo;d the noble pair,&mdash;<br/>
    An old, old monastery once, and now<br/>
Still older mansion; of a rich and rare<br/>
    Mix&rsquo;d Gothic, such as artists all allow<br/>
Few specimens yet left us can compare<br/>
    Withal: it lies perhaps a little low,<br/>
Because the monks preferr&rsquo;d a hill behind,<br/>
To shelter their devotion from the wind.<br/>
<br/>
It stood embosom&rsquo;d in a happy valley,<br/>
    Crown&rsquo;d by high woodlands, where the Druid oak<br/>
Stood like Caractacus in act to rally<br/>
    His host, with broad arms &rsquo;gainst the thunderstroke;<br/>
And from beneath his boughs were seen to sally<br/>
    The dappled foresters&mdash;as day awoke,<br/>
The branching stag swept down with all his herd,<br/>
To quaff a brook which murmur&rsquo;d like a bird.<br/>
<br/>
Before the mansion lay a lucid lake,<br/>
    Broad as transparent, deep, and freshly fed<br/>
By a river, which its soften&rsquo;d way did take<br/>
    In currents through the calmer water spread<br/>
Around: the wildfowl nestled in the brake<br/>
    And sedges, brooding in their liquid bed:<br/>
The woods sloped downwards to its brink, and stood<br/>
With their green faces fix&rsquo;d upon the flood.<br/>
<br/>
Its outlet dash&rsquo;d into a deep cascade,<br/>
    Sparkling with foam, until again subsiding,<br/>
Its shriller echoes&mdash;like an infant made<br/>
    Quiet&mdash;sank into softer ripples, gliding<br/>
Into a rivulet; and thus allay&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Pursued its course, now gleaming, and now hiding<br/>
Its windings through the woods; now clear, now blue,<br/>
According as the skies their shadows threw.<br/>
<br/>
A glorious remnant of the Gothic pile<br/>
    (While yet the church was Rome&rsquo;s) stood half apart<br/>
In a grand arch, which once screen&rsquo;d many an aisle.<br/>
    These last had disappear&rsquo;d&mdash;a loss to art:<br/>
The first yet frown&rsquo;d superbly o&rsquo;er the soil,<br/>
    And kindled feelings in the roughest heart,<br/>
Which mourn&rsquo;d the power of time&rsquo;s or tempest&rsquo;s march,<br/>
In gazing on that venerable arch.<br/>
<br/>
Within a niche, nigh to its pinnacle,<br/>
    Twelve saints had once stood sanctified in stone;<br/>
But these had fallen, not when the friars fell,<br/>
    But in the war which struck Charles from his throne,<br/>
When each house was a fortalice, as tell<br/>
    The annals of full many a line undone,&mdash;<br/>
The gallant cavaliers, who fought in vain<br/>
For those who knew not to resign or reign.<br/>
<br/>
But in a higher niche, alone, but crowned,<br/>
    The Virgin Mother of the God-born Child,<br/>
With her Son in her blessed arms, look&rsquo;d round,<br/>
    Spared by some chance when all beside was spoil&rsquo;d;<br/>
She made the earth below seem holy ground.<br/>
    This may be superstition, weak or wild,<br/>
But even the faintest relics of a shrine<br/>
Of any worship wake some thoughts divine.<br/>
<br/>
A mighty window, hollow in the centre,<br/>
    Shorn of its glass of thousand colourings,<br/>
Through which the deepen&rsquo;d glories once could enter,<br/>
    Streaming from off the sun like seraph&rsquo;s wings,<br/>
Now yawns all desolate: now loud, now fainter,<br/>
    The gale sweeps through its fretwork, and oft sings<br/>
The owl his anthem, where the silenced quire<br/>
Lie with their hallelujahs quench&rsquo;d like fire.<br/>
<br/>
But in the noontide of the moon, and when<br/>
    The wind is winged from one point of heaven,<br/>
There moans a strange unearthly sound, which then<br/>
    Is musical&mdash;a dying accent driven<br/>
Through the huge arch, which soars and sinks again.<br/>
    Some deem it but the distant echo given<br/>
Back to the night wind by the waterfall,<br/>
And harmonised by the old choral wall:<br/>
<br/>
Others, that some original shape, or form<br/>
    Shaped by decay perchance, hath given the power<br/>
(Though less than that of Memnon&rsquo;s statue, warm<br/>
    In Egypt&rsquo;s rays, to harp at a fix&rsquo;d hour)<br/>
To this grey ruin, with a voice to charm.<br/>
    Sad, but serene, it sweeps o&rsquo;er tree or tower;<br/>
The cause I know not, nor can solve; but such<br/>
The fact:&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard it&mdash;once perhaps too much.<br/>
<br/>
Amidst the court a Gothic fountain play&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Symmetrical, but deck&rsquo;d with carvings quaint&mdash;<br/>
Strange faces, like to men in masquerade,<br/>
    And here perhaps a monster, there a saint:<br/>
The spring gush&rsquo;d through grim mouths of granite made,<br/>
    And sparkled into basins, where it spent<br/>
Its little torrent in a thousand bubbles,<br/>
Like man&rsquo;s vain glory, and his vainer troubles.<br/>
<br/>
The mansion&rsquo;s self was vast and venerable,<br/>
    With more of the monastic than has been<br/>
Elsewhere preserved: the cloisters still were stable,<br/>
    The cells, too, and refectory, I ween:<br/>
An exquisite small chapel had been able,<br/>
    Still unimpair&rsquo;d, to decorate the scene;<br/>
The rest had been reform&rsquo;d, replaced, or sunk,<br/>
And spoke more of the baron than the monk.<br/>
<br/>
Huge halls, long galleries, spacious chambers, join&rsquo;d<br/>
    By no quite lawful marriage of the arts,<br/>
Might shock a connoisseur; but when combined,<br/>
    Form&rsquo;d a whole which, irregular in parts,<br/>
Yet left a grand impression on the mind,<br/>
    At least of those whose eyes are in their hearts:<br/>
We gaze upon a giant for his stature,<br/>
Nor judge at first if all be true to nature.<br/>
<br/>
Steel barons, molten the next generation<br/>
    To silken rows of gay and garter&rsquo;d earls,<br/>
Glanced from the walls in goodly preservation;<br/>
    And Lady Marys blooming into girls,<br/>
With fair long locks, had also kept their station;<br/>
    And countesses mature in robes and pearls:<br/>
Also some beauties of Sir Peter Lely,<br/>
Whose drapery hints we may admire them freely.<br/>
<br/>
Judges in very formidable ermine<br/>
    Were there, with brows that did not much invite<br/>
The accused to think their lordships would determine<br/>
    His cause by leaning much from might to right:<br/>
Bishops, who had not left a single sermon:<br/>
    Attorneys-general, awful to the sight,<br/>
As hinting more (unless our judgments warp us)<br/>
Of the &lsquo;Star Chamber&rsquo; than of &lsquo;Habeas Corpus.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Generals, some all in armour, of the old<br/>
    And iron time, ere lead had ta&rsquo;en the lead;<br/>
Others in wigs of Marlborough&rsquo;s martial fold,<br/>
    Huger than twelve of our degenerate breed:<br/>
Lordlings, with staves of white or keys of gold:<br/>
    Nimrods, whose canvass scarce contain&rsquo;d the steed;<br/>
And here and there some stern high patriot stood,<br/>
Who could not get the place for which he sued.<br/>
<br/>
But ever and anon, to soothe your vision,<br/>
    Fatigued with these hereditary glories,<br/>
There rose a Carlo Dolce or a Titian,<br/>
    Or wilder group of savage Salvatore&rsquo;s;<br/>
Here danced Albano&rsquo;s boys, and here the sea shone<br/>
    In Vernet&rsquo;s ocean lights; and there the stories<br/>
Of martyrs awed, as Spagnoletto tainted<br/>
His brush with all the blood of all the sainted.<br/>
<br/>
Here sweetly spread a landscape of Lorraine;<br/>
    There Rembrandt made his darkness equal light,<br/>
Or gloomy Caravaggio&rsquo;s gloomier stain<br/>
    Bronzed o&rsquo;er some lean and stoic anchorite:&mdash;<br/>
But, lo! a Teniers woos, and not in vain,<br/>
    Your eyes to revel in a livelier sight:<br/>
His bell-mouth&rsquo;d goblet makes me feel quite Danish<br/>
Or Dutch with thirst&mdash;What, ho! a flask of Rhenish.<br/>
<br/>
O reader! if that thou canst read,&mdash;and know,<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis not enough to spell, or even to read,<br/>
To constitute a reader; there must go<br/>
    Virtues of which both you and I have need;&mdash;<br/>
Firstly, begin with the beginning (though<br/>
    That clause is hard); and secondly, proceed;<br/>
Thirdly, commence not with the end&mdash;or, sinning<br/>
In this sort, end at least with the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
But, reader, thou hast patient been of late,<br/>
    While I, without remorse of rhyme, or fear,<br/>
Have built and laid out ground at such a rate,<br/>
    Dan Phoebus takes me for an auctioneer.<br/>
That poets were so from their earliest date,<br/>
    By Homer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Catalogue of ships&rsquo; is clear;<br/>
But a mere modern must be moderate&mdash;<br/>
I spare you then the furniture and plate.<br/>
<br/>
The mellow autumn came, and with it came<br/>
    The promised party, to enjoy its sweets.<br/>
The corn is cut, the manor full of game;<br/>
    The pointer ranges, and the sportsman beats<br/>
In russet jacket:&mdash;lynx-like is his aim;<br/>
    Full grows his bag, and wonderful his feats.<br/>
Ah, nut-brown partridges! Ah, brilliant pheasants!<br/>
And ah, ye poachers!&mdash;&rsquo;Tis no sport for peasants.<br/>
<br/>
An English autumn, though it hath no vines,<br/>
    Blushing with Bacchant coronals along<br/>
The paths, o&rsquo;er which the far festoon entwines<br/>
    The red grape in the sunny lands of song,<br/>
Hath yet a purchased choice of choicest wines;<br/>
    The claret light, and the Madeira strong.<br/>
If Britain mourn her bleakness, we can tell her,<br/>
The very best of vineyards is the cellar.<br/>
<br/>
Then, if she hath not that serene decline<br/>
    Which makes the southern autumn&rsquo;s day appear<br/>
As if &rsquo;twould to a second spring resign<br/>
    The season, rather than to winter drear,<br/>
Of in-door comforts still she hath a mine,&mdash;<br/>
    The sea-coal fires the &lsquo;earliest of the year;&rsquo;<br/>
Without doors, too, she may compete in mellow,<br/>
As what is lost in green is gain&rsquo;d in yellow.<br/>
<br/>
And for the effeminate villeggiatura&mdash;<br/>
    Rife with more horns than hounds&mdash;she hath the chase,<br/>
So animated that it might allure<br/>
    Saint from his beads to join the jocund race;<br/>
Even Nimrod&rsquo;s self might leave the plains of Dura,<br/>
    And wear the Melton jacket for a space:<br/>
If she hath no wild boars, she hath a tame<br/>
Preserve of bores, who ought to be made game.<br/>
<br/>
The noble guests, assembled at the Abbey,<br/>
    Consisted of&mdash;we give the sex the pas&mdash;<br/>
The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke; the Countess Crabby;<br/>
    The Ladies Scilly, Busey;&mdash;Miss Eclat,<br/>
Miss Bombazeen, Miss Mackstay, Miss O&rsquo;Tabby,<br/>
    And Mrs. Rabbi, the rich banker&rsquo;s squaw;<br/>
Also the honourable Mrs. Sleep,<br/>
Who look&rsquo;d a white lamb, yet was a black sheep:<br/>
<br/>
With other Countesses of Blank&mdash;but rank;<br/>
    At once the&rsquo;lie&rsquo; and the &lsquo;elite&rsquo; of crowds;<br/>
Who pass like water filter&rsquo;d in a tank,<br/>
    All purged and pious from their native clouds;<br/>
Or paper turn&rsquo;d to money by the Bank:<br/>
    No matter how or why, the passport shrouds<br/>
The &lsquo;passee&rsquo; and the past; for good society<br/>
Is no less famed for tolerance than piety,&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
That is, up to a certain point; which point<br/>
    Forms the most difficult in punctuation.<br/>
Appearances appear to form the joint<br/>
    On which it hinges in a higher station;<br/>
And so that no explosion cry &lsquo;Aroint<br/>
    Thee, witch!&rsquo; or each Medea has her Jason;<br/>
Or (to the point with Horace and with Pulci)<br/>
&lsquo;Omne tulit punctum, quae miscuit utile dulci.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
I can&rsquo;t exactly trace their rule of right,<br/>
    Which hath a little leaning to a lottery.<br/>
I&rsquo;ve seen a virtuous woman put down quite<br/>
    By the mere combination of a coterie;<br/>
Also a so-so matron boldly fight<br/>
    Her way back to the world by dint of plottery,<br/>
And shine the very Siria of the spheres,<br/>
Escaping with a few slight, scarless sneers.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen more than I&rsquo;ll say:&mdash;but we will see<br/>
    How our villeggiatura will get on.<br/>
The party might consist of thirty-three<br/>
    Of highest caste&mdash;the Brahmins of the ton.<br/>
I have named a few, not foremost in degree,<br/>
    But ta&rsquo;en at hazard as the rhyme may run.<br/>
By way of sprinkling, scatter&rsquo;d amongst these,<br/>
There also were some Irish absentees.<br/>
<br/>
There was Parolles, too, the legal bully,<br/>
    Who limits all his battles to the bar<br/>
And senate: when invited elsewhere, truly,<br/>
    He shows more appetite for words than war.<br/>
There was the young bard Rackrhyme, who had newly<br/>
    Come out and glimmer&rsquo;d as a six weeks&rsquo; star.<br/>
There was Lord Pyrrho, too, the great freethinker;<br/>
And Sir John Pottledeep, the mighty drinker.<br/>
<br/>
There was the Duke of Dash, who was a&mdash;duke,<br/>
    &lsquo;Ay, every inch a&rsquo; duke; there were twelve peers<br/>
Like Charlemagne&rsquo;s&mdash;and all such peers in look<br/>
    And intellect, that neither eyes nor ears<br/>
For commoners had ever them mistook.<br/>
    There were the six Miss Rawbolds&mdash;pretty dears!<br/>
All song and sentiment; whose hearts were set<br/>
Less on a convent than a coronet.<br/>
<br/>
There were four Honourable Misters, whose<br/>
    Honour was more before their names than after;<br/>
There was the preux Chevalier de la Ruse,<br/>
    Whom France and Fortune lately deign&rsquo;d to waft here,<br/>
Whose chiefly harmless talent was to amuse;<br/>
    But the clubs found it rather serious laughter,<br/>
Because&mdash;such was his magic power to please&mdash;<br/>
The dice seem&rsquo;d charm&rsquo;d, too, with his repartees.<br/>
<br/>
There was Dick Dubious, the metaphysician,<br/>
    Who loved philosophy and a good dinner;<br/>
Angle, the soi-disant mathematician;<br/>
    Sir Henry Silvercup, the great race-winner.<br/>
There was the Reverend Rodomont Precisian,<br/>
    Who did not hate so much the sin as sinner;<br/>
And Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet,<br/>
Good at all things, but better at a bet.<br/>
<br/>
There was jack jargon, the gigantic guardsman;<br/>
    And General Fireface, famous in the field,<br/>
A great tactician, and no less a swordsman,<br/>
    Who ate, last war, more Yankees than he kill&rsquo;d.<br/>
There was the waggish Welsh Judge, Jefferies Hardsman,<br/>
    In his grave office so completely skill&rsquo;d,<br/>
That when a culprit came far condemnation,<br/>
He had his judge&rsquo;s joke for consolation.<br/>
<br/>
Good company &rsquo;s a chess-board&mdash;there are kings,<br/>
    Queens, bishops, knights, rooks, pawns; the world &rsquo;s a game;<br/>
Save that the puppets pull at their own strings,<br/>
    Methinks gay Punch hath something of the same.<br/>
My Muse, the butterfly hath but her wings,<br/>
    Not stings, and flits through ether without aim,<br/>
Alighting rarely:&mdash;were she but a hornet,<br/>
Perhaps there might be vices which would mourn it.<br/>
<br/>
I had forgotten&mdash;but must not forget&mdash;<br/>
    An orator, the latest of the session,<br/>
Who had deliver&rsquo;d well a very set<br/>
    Smooth speech, his first and maidenly transgression<br/>
Upon debate: the papers echoed yet<br/>
    With his debut, which made a strong impression,<br/>
And rank&rsquo;d with what is every day display&rsquo;d&mdash;<br/>
&lsquo;The best first speech that ever yet was made.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Proud of his &lsquo;Hear hims!&rsquo; proud, too, of his vote<br/>
    And lost virginity of oratory,<br/>
Proud of his learning (just enough to quote),<br/>
    He revell&rsquo;d in his Ciceronian glory:<br/>
With memory excellent to get by rote,<br/>
    With wit to hatch a pun or tell a story,<br/>
Graced with some merit, and with more effrontery,<br/>
&lsquo;His country&rsquo;s pride,&rsquo; he came down to the country.<br/>
<br/>
There also were two wits by acclamation,<br/>
    Longbow from Ireland, Strongbow from the Tweed,<br/>
Both lawyers and both men of education;<br/>
    But Strongbow&rsquo;s wit was of more polish&rsquo;d breed:<br/>
Longbow was rich in an imagination<br/>
    As beautiful and bounding as a steed,<br/>
But sometimes stumbling over a potato,&mdash;<br/>
While Strongbow&rsquo;s best things might have come from Cato.<br/>
<br/>
Strongbow was like a new-tuned harpsichord;<br/>
    But Longbow wild as an AEolian harp,<br/>
With which the winds of heaven can claim accord,<br/>
    And make a music, whether flat or sharp.<br/>
Of Strongbow&rsquo;s talk you would not change a word:<br/>
    At Longbow&rsquo;s phrases you might sometimes carp:<br/>
Both wits&mdash;one born so, and the other bred&mdash;<br/>
This by his heart, his rival by his head.<br/>
<br/>
If all these seem a heterogeneous mas<br/>
    To be assembled at a country seat,<br/>
Yet think, a specimen of every class<br/>
    Is better than a humdrum tete-a-tete.<br/>
The days of Comedy are gone, alas!<br/>
    When Congreve&rsquo;s fool could vie with Moliere&rsquo;s bete:<br/>
Society is smooth&rsquo;d to that excess,<br/>
That manners hardly differ more than dress.<br/>
<br/>
Our ridicules are kept in the back-ground&mdash;<br/>
    Ridiculous enough, but also dull;<br/>
Professions, too, are no more to be found<br/>
    Professional; and there is nought to cull<br/>
Of folly&rsquo;s fruit; for though your fools abound,<br/>
    They&rsquo;re barren, and not worth the pains to pull.<br/>
Society is now one polish&rsquo;d horde,<br/>
Form&rsquo;d of two mighty tribes, the Bores and Bored.<br/>
<br/>
But from being farmers, we turn gleaners, gleaning<br/>
    The scanty but right-well thresh&rsquo;d ears of truth;<br/>
And, gentle reader! when you gather meaning,<br/>
    You may be Boaz, and I&mdash;modest Ruth.<br/>
Farther I&rsquo;d quote, but Scripture intervening<br/>
    Forbids. Its great impression in my youth<br/>
Was made by Mrs. Adams, where she cries,<br/>
&lsquo;That Scriptures out of church are blasphemies.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
But what we can we glean in this vile age<br/>
    Of chaff, although our gleanings be not grist.<br/>
I must not quite omit the talking sage,<br/>
    Kit-Cat, the famous Conversationist,<br/>
Who, in his common-place book, had a page<br/>
    Prepared each morn for evenings. &lsquo;List, oh, list!&rsquo;-<br/>
&lsquo;Alas, poor ghost!&rsquo;&mdash;What unexpected woes<br/>
Await those who have studied their bon-mots!<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, they must allure the conversation<br/>
    By many windings to their clever clinch;<br/>
And secondly, must let slip no occasion,<br/>
    Nor bate (abate) their hearers of an inch,<br/>
But take an ell&mdash;and make a great sensation,<br/>
    If possible; and thirdly, never flinch<br/>
When some smart talker puts them to the test,<br/>
But seize the last word, which no doubt &rsquo;s the best.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Henry and his lady were the hosts;<br/>
    The party we have touch&rsquo;d on were the guests:<br/>
Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts<br/>
    To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts.<br/>
I will not dwell upon ragouts or roasts,<br/>
    Albeit all human history attests<br/>
That happiness for man&mdash;the hungry sinner!-<br/>
Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Witness the lands which &lsquo;flow&rsquo;d with milk and honey,&rsquo;<br/>
    Held out unto the hungry Israelites;<br/>
To this we have added since, the love of money,<br/>
    The only sort of pleasure which requites.<br/>
Youth fades, and leaves our days no longer sunny;<br/>
    We tire of mistresses and parasites;<br/>
But oh, ambrosial cash! Ah! who would lose thee?<br/>
When we no more can use, or even abuse thee!<br/>
<br/>
The gentlemen got up betimes to shoot,<br/>
    Or hunt: the young, because they liked the sport&mdash;<br/>
The first thing boys like after play and fruit;<br/>
    The middle-aged to make the day more short;<br/>
For ennui is a growth of English root,<br/>
    Though nameless in our language:&mdash;we retort<br/>
The fact for words, and let the French translate<br/>
That awful yawn which sleep can not abate.<br/>
<br/>
The elderly walk&rsquo;d through the library,<br/>
    And tumbled books, or criticised the pictures,<br/>
Or saunter&rsquo;d through the gardens piteously,<br/>
    And made upon the hot-house several strictures,<br/>
Or rode a nag which trotted not too high,<br/>
    Or on the morning papers read their lectures,<br/>
Or on the watch their longing eyes would fix,<br/>
Longing at sixty for the hour of six.<br/>
<br/>
But none were &lsquo;gene:&rsquo; the great hour of union<br/>
    Was rung by dinner&rsquo;s knell; till then all were<br/>
Masters of their own time&mdash;or in communion,<br/>
    Or solitary, as they chose to bear<br/>
The hours, which how to pass is but to few known.<br/>
    Each rose up at his own, and had to spare<br/>
What time he chose for dress, and broke his fast<br/>
When, where, and how he chose for that repast.<br/>
<br/>
The ladies&mdash;some rouged, some a little pale&mdash;<br/>
    Met the morn as they might. If fine, they rode,<br/>
Or walk&rsquo;d; if foul, they read, or told a tale,<br/>
    Sung, or rehearsed the last dance from abroad;<br/>
Discuss&rsquo;d the fashion which might next prevail,<br/>
    And settled bonnets by the newest code,<br/>
Or cramm&rsquo;d twelve sheets into one little letter,<br/>
To make each correspondent a new debtor.<br/>
<br/>
For some had absent lovers, all had friends.<br/>
    The earth has nothing like a she epistle,<br/>
And hardly heaven&mdash;because it never ends.<br/>
    I love the mystery of a female missal,<br/>
Which, like a creed, ne&rsquo;er says all it intends,<br/>
    But full of cunning as Ulysses&rsquo; whistle,<br/>
When he allured poor Dolon:&mdash;you had better<br/>
Take care what you reply to such a letter.<br/>
<br/>
Then there were billiards; cards, too, but no dice;&mdash;<br/>
    Save in the clubs no man of honour plays;&mdash;<br/>
Boats when &rsquo;twas water, skating when &rsquo;twas ice,<br/>
    And the hard frost destroy&rsquo;d the scenting days:<br/>
And angling, too, that solitary vice,<br/>
    Whatever Izaak Walton sings or says;<br/>
The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb, in his gullet<br/>
Should have a hook, and a small trout to pull it.<br/>
<br/>
With evening came the banquet and the wine;<br/>
    The conversazione; the duet,<br/>
Attuned by voices more or less divine<br/>
    (My heart or head aches with the memory yet).<br/>
The four Miss Rawbolds in a glee would shine;<br/>
    But the two youngest loved more to be set<br/>
Down to the harp&mdash;because to music&rsquo;s charms<br/>
They added graceful necks, white hands and arms.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a dance (though rarely on field days,<br/>
    For then the gentlemen were rather tired)<br/>
Display&rsquo;d some sylph-like figures in its maze;<br/>
    Then there was small-talk ready when required;<br/>
Flirtation&mdash;but decorous; the mere praise<br/>
    Of charms that should or should not be admired.<br/>
The hunters fought their fox-hunt o&rsquo;er again,<br/>
And then retreated soberly&mdash;at ten.<br/>
<br/>
The politicians, in a nook apart,<br/>
    Discuss&rsquo;d the world, and settled all the spheres;<br/>
The wits watch&rsquo;d every loophole for their art,<br/>
    To introduce a bon-mot head and ears;<br/>
Small is the rest of those who would be smart,<br/>
    A moment&rsquo;s good thing may have cost them years<br/>
Before they find an hour to introduce it;<br/>
And then, even then, some bore may make them lose it.<br/>
<br/>
But all was gentle and aristocratic<br/>
    In this our party; polish&rsquo;d, smooth, and cold,<br/>
As Phidian forms cut out of marble Attic.<br/>
    There now are no Squire Westerns as of old;<br/>
And our Sophias are not so emphatic,<br/>
    But fair as then, or fairer to behold.<br/>
We have no accomplish&rsquo;d blackguards, like Tom Jones,<br/>
But gentlemen in stays, as stiff as stones.<br/>
<br/>
They separated at an early hour;<br/>
    That is, ere midnight&mdash;which is London&rsquo;s noon:<br/>
But in the country ladies seek their bower<br/>
    A little earlier than the waning moon.<br/>
Peace to the slumbers of each folded flower&mdash;<br/>
    May the rose call back its true colour soon!<br/>
Good hours of fair cheeks are the fairest tinters,<br/>
And lower the price of rouge&mdash;at least some winters.<br/>

<h2><a name="2H_4_0015"></a>
CANTO THE FOURTEENTH.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
If from great nature&rsquo;s or our own abyss<br/>
    Of thought we could but snatch a certainty,<br/>
Perhaps mankind might find the path they miss&mdash;<br/>
    But then &rsquo;twould spoil much good philosophy.<br/>
One system eats another up, and this<br/>
    Much as old Saturn ate his progeny;<br/>
For when his pious consort gave him stones<br/>
In lieu of sons, of these he made no bones.<br/>
<br/>
But System doth reverse the Titan&rsquo;s breakfast,<br/>
    And eats her parents, albeit the digestion<br/>
Is difficult. Pray tell me, can you make fast,<br/>
    After due search, your faith to any question?<br/>
Look back o&rsquo;er ages, ere unto the stake fast<br/>
    You bind yourself, and call some mode the best one.<br/>
Nothing more true than not to trust your senses;<br/>
And yet what are your other evidences?<br/>
<br/>
For me, I know nought; nothing I deny,<br/>
    Admit, reject, contemn; and what know you,<br/>
Except perhaps that you were born to die?<br/>
    And both may after all turn out untrue.<br/>
An age may come, Font of Eternity,<br/>
    When nothing shall be either old or new.<br/>
Death, so call&rsquo;d, is a thing which makes men weep,<br/>
And yet a third of life is pass&rsquo;d in sleep.<br/>
<br/>
A sleep without dreams, after a rough day<br/>
    Of toil, is what we covet most; and yet<br/>
How clay shrinks back from more quiescent clay!<br/>
    The very Suicide that pays his debt<br/>
At once without instalments (an old way<br/>
    Of paying debts, which creditors regret)<br/>
Lets out impatiently his rushing breath,<br/>
Less from disgust of life than dread of death.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis round him, near him, here, there, every where;<br/>
    And there&rsquo;s a courage which grows out of fear,<br/>
Perhaps of all most desperate, which will dare<br/>
    The worst to know it:&mdash;when the mountains rear<br/>
Their peaks beneath your human foot, and there<br/>
    You look down o&rsquo;er the precipice, and drear<br/>
The gulf of rock yawns,&mdash;you can&rsquo;t gaze a minute<br/>
Without an awful wish to plunge within it.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis true, you don&rsquo;t&mdash;but, pale and struck with terror,<br/>
    Retire: but look into your past impression!<br/>
And you will find, though shuddering at the mirror<br/>
    Of your own thoughts, in all their self-confession,<br/>
The lurking bias, be it truth or error,<br/>
    To the unknown; a secret prepossession,<br/>
To plunge with all your fears&mdash;but where? You know not,<br/>
And that&rsquo;s the reason why you do&mdash;or do not.<br/>
<br/>
But what &rsquo;s this to the purpose? you will say.<br/>
    Gent. reader, nothing; a mere speculation,<br/>
For which my sole excuse is&mdash;&rsquo;tis my way;<br/>
    Sometimes with and sometimes without occasion<br/>
I write what &rsquo;s uppermost, without delay:<br/>
    This narrative is not meant for narration,<br/>
But a mere airy and fantastic basis,<br/>
To build up common things with common places.<br/>
<br/>
You know, or don&rsquo;t know, that great Bacon saith,<br/>
    &lsquo;Fling up a straw, &rsquo;twill show the way the wind blows;&rsquo;<br/>
And such a straw, borne on by human breath,<br/>
    Is poesy, according as the mind glows;<br/>
A paper kite which flies &rsquo;twixt life and death,<br/>
    A shadow which the onward soul behind throws:<br/>
And mine &rsquo;s a bubble, not blown up for praise,<br/>
But just to play with, as an infant plays.<br/>
<br/>
The world is all before me&mdash;or behind;<br/>
    For I have seen a portion of that same,<br/>
And quite enough for me to keep in mind;&mdash;<br/>
    Of passions, too, I have proved enough to blame,<br/>
To the great pleasure of our friends, mankind,<br/>
    Who like to mix some slight alloy with fame;<br/>
For I was rather famous in my time,<br/>
Until I fairly knock&rsquo;d it up with rhyme.<br/>
<br/>
I have brought this world about my ears, and eke<br/>
    The other; that &rsquo;s to say, the clergy, who<br/>
Upon my head have bid their thunders break<br/>
    In pious libels by no means a few.<br/>
And yet I can&rsquo;t help scribbling once a week,<br/>
    Tiring old readers, nor discovering new.<br/>
In youth I wrote because my mind was full,<br/>
And now because I feel it growing dull.<br/>
<br/>
But &lsquo;why then publish?&rsquo;&mdash;There are no rewards<br/>
    Of fame or profit when the world grows weary.<br/>
I ask in turn,&mdash;Why do you play at cards?<br/>
    Why drink? Why read?&mdash;To make some hour less dreary.<br/>
It occupies me to turn back regards<br/>
    On what I&rsquo;ve seen or ponder&rsquo;d, sad or cheery;<br/>
And what I write I cast upon the stream,<br/>
To swim or sink&mdash;I have had at least my dream.<br/>
<br/>
I think that were I certain of success,<br/>
    I hardly could compose another line:<br/>
So long I&rsquo;ve battled either more or less,<br/>
    That no defeat can drive me from the Nine.<br/>
This feeling &rsquo;tis not easy to express,<br/>
    And yet &rsquo;tis not affected, I opine.<br/>
In play, there are two pleasures for your choosing&mdash;<br/>
The one is winning, and the other losing.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, my Muse by no means deals in fiction:<br/>
    She gathers a repertory of facts,<br/>
Of course with some reserve and slight restriction,<br/>
    But mostly sings of human things and acts&mdash;<br/>
And that &rsquo;s one cause she meets with contradiction;<br/>
    For too much truth, at first sight, ne&rsquo;er attracts;<br/>
And were her object only what &rsquo;s call&rsquo;d glory,<br/>
With more ease too she&rsquo;d tell a different story.<br/>
<br/>
Love, war, a tempest&mdash;surely there&rsquo;s variety;<br/>
    Also a seasoning slight of lucubration;<br/>
A bird&rsquo;s-eye view, too, of that wild, Society;<br/>
    A slight glance thrown on men of every station.<br/>
If you have nought else, here&rsquo;s at least satiety<br/>
    Both in performance and in preparation;<br/>
And though these lines should only line portmanteaus,<br/>
Trade will be all the better for these Cantos.<br/>
<br/>
The portion of this world which I at present<br/>
    Have taken up to fill the following sermon,<br/>
Is one of which there&rsquo;s no description recent.<br/>
    The reason why is easy to determine:<br/>
Although it seems both prominent and pleasant,<br/>
    There is a sameness in its gems and ermine,<br/>
A dull and family likeness through all ages,<br/>
Of no great promise for poetic pages.<br/>
<br/>
With much to excite, there&rsquo;s little to exalt;<br/>
    Nothing that speaks to all men and all times;<br/>
A sort of varnish over every fault;<br/>
    A kind of common-place, even in their crimes;<br/>
Factitious passions, wit without much salt,<br/>
    A want of that true nature which sublimes<br/>
Whate&rsquo;er it shows with truth; a smooth monotony<br/>
Of character, in those at least who have got any.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, indeed, like soldiers off parade,<br/>
    They break their ranks and gladly leave the drill;<br/>
But then the roll-call draws them back afraid,<br/>
    And they must be or seem what they were: still<br/>
Doubtless it is a brilliant masquerade;<br/>
    But when of the first sight you have had your fill,<br/>
It palls&mdash;at least it did so upon me,<br/>
This paradise of pleasure and ennui.<br/>
<br/>
When we have made our love, and gamed our gaming,<br/>
    Drest, voted, shone, and, may be, something more;<br/>
With dandies dined; heard senators declaiming;<br/>
    Seen beauties brought to market by the score,<br/>
Sad rakes to sadder husbands chastely taming;<br/>
    There&rsquo;s little left but to be bored or bore.<br/>
Witness those &lsquo;ci-devant jeunes hommes&rsquo; who stem<br/>
The stream, nor leave the world which leaveth them.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis said&mdash;indeed a general complaint&mdash;<br/>
    That no one has succeeded in describing<br/>
The monde, exactly as they ought to paint:<br/>
    Some say, that authors only snatch, by bribing<br/>
The porter, some slight scandals strange and quaint,<br/>
    To furnish matter for their moral gibing;<br/>
And that their books have but one style in common&mdash;<br/>
My lady&rsquo;s prattle, filter&rsquo;d through her woman.<br/>
<br/>
But this can&rsquo;t well be true, just now; for writers<br/>
    Are grown of the beau monde a part potential:<br/>
I&rsquo;ve seen them balance even the scale with fighters,<br/>
    Especially when young, for that &rsquo;s essential.<br/>
Why do their sketches fail them as inditers<br/>
    Of what they deem themselves most consequential,<br/>
The real portrait of the highest tribe?<br/>
&rsquo;Tis that, in fact, there&rsquo;s little to describe.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Haud ignara loquor;&rsquo; these are Nugae, &lsquo;quarum<br/>
    Pars parva fui,&rsquo; but still art and part.<br/>
Now I could much more easily sketch a harem,<br/>
    A battle, wreck, or history of the heart,<br/>
Than these things; and besides, I wish to spare &rsquo;em,<br/>
    For reasons which I choose to keep apart.<br/>
&lsquo;Vetabo Cereris sacrum qui vulgarit&mdash;&rsquo;<br/>
Which means that vulgar people must not share it.<br/>
<br/>
And therefore what I throw off is ideal&mdash;<br/>
    Lower&rsquo;d, leaven&rsquo;d, like a history of freemasons;<br/>
Which bears the same relation to the real,<br/>
    As Captain Parry&rsquo;s voyage may do to Jason&rsquo;s.<br/>
The grand arcanum &rsquo;s not for men to see all;<br/>
    My music has some mystic diapasons;<br/>
And there is much which could not be appreciated<br/>
In any manner by the uninitiated.<br/>
<br/>
Alas! worlds fall&mdash;and woman, since she fell&rsquo;d<br/>
    The world (as, since that history less polite<br/>
Than true, hath been a creed so strictly held)<br/>
    Has not yet given up the practice quite.<br/>
Poor thing of usages! coerced, compell&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Victim when wrong, and martyr oft when right,<br/>
Condemn&rsquo;d to child-bed, as men for their sins<br/>
Have shaving too entail&rsquo;d upon their chins,&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
A daily plague, which in the aggregate<br/>
    May average on the whole with parturition.<br/>
But as to women, who can penetrate<br/>
    The real sufferings of their she condition?<br/>
Man&rsquo;s very sympathy with their estate<br/>
    Has much of selfishness, and more suspicion.<br/>
Their love, their virtue, beauty, education,<br/>
But form good housekeepers, to breed a nation.<br/>
<br/>
All this were very well, and can&rsquo;t be better;<br/>
    But even this is difficult, Heaven knows,<br/>
So many troubles from her birth beset her,<br/>
    Such small distinction between friends and foes,<br/>
The gilding wears so soon from off her fetter,<br/>
    That&mdash;but ask any woman if she&rsquo;d choose<br/>
(Take her at thirty, that is) to have been<br/>
Female or male? a schoolboy or a queen?<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Petticoat influence&rsquo; is a great reproach,<br/>
    Which even those who obey would fain be thought<br/>
To fly from, as from hungry pikes a roach;<br/>
    But since beneath it upon earth we are brought,<br/>
By various joltings of life&rsquo;s hackney coach,<br/>
    I for one venerate a petticoat&mdash;<br/>
A garment of a mystical sublimity,<br/>
No matter whether russet, silk, or dimity.<br/>
<br/>
Much I respect, and much I have adored,<br/>
    In my young days, that chaste and goodly veil,<br/>
Which holds a treasure, like a miser&rsquo;s hoard,<br/>
    And more attracts by all it doth conceal&mdash;<br/>
A golden scabbard on a Damasque sword,<br/>
    A loving letter with a mystic seal,<br/>
A cure for grief&mdash;for what can ever rankle<br/>
Before a petticoat and peeping ankle?<br/>
<br/>
And when upon a silent, sullen day,<br/>
    With a sirocco, for example, blowing,<br/>
When even the sea looks dim with all its spray,<br/>
    And sulkily the river&rsquo;s ripple &rsquo;s flowing,<br/>
And the sky shows that very ancient gray,<br/>
    The sober, sad antithesis to glowing,&mdash;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis pleasant, if then any thing is pleasant,<br/>
To catch a glimpse even of a pretty peasant.<br/>
<br/>
We left our heroes and our heroines<br/>
    In that fair clime which don&rsquo;t depend on climate,<br/>
Quite independent of the Zodiac&rsquo;s signs,<br/>
    Though certainly more difficult to rhyme at,<br/>
Because the sun, and stars, and aught that shines,<br/>
    Mountains, and all we can be most sublime at,<br/>
Are there oft dull and dreary as a dun&mdash;<br/>
Whether a sky&rsquo;s or tradesman&rsquo;s is all one.<br/>
<br/>
An in-door life is less poetical;<br/>
    And out of door hath showers, and mists, and sleet,<br/>
With which I could not brew a pastoral.<br/>
    But be it as it may, a bard must meet<br/>
All difficulties, whether great or small,<br/>
    To spoil his undertaking or complete,<br/>
And work away like spirit upon matter,<br/>
Embarrass&rsquo;d somewhat both with fire and water.<br/>
<br/>
Juan&mdash;in this respect, at least, like saints&mdash;<br/>
    Was all things unto people of all sorts,<br/>
And lived contentedly, without complaints,<br/>
    In camps, in ships, in cottages, or courts&mdash;<br/>
Born with that happy soul which seldom faints,<br/>
    And mingling modestly in toils or sports.<br/>
He likewise could be most things to all women,<br/>
Without the coxcombry of certain she men.<br/>
<br/>
A fox-hunt to a foreigner is strange;<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis also subject to the double danger<br/>
Of tumbling first, and having in exchange<br/>
    Some pleasant jesting at the awkward stranger:<br/>
But Juan had been early taught to range<br/>
    The wilds, as doth an Arab turn&rsquo;d avenger,<br/>
So that his horse, or charger, hunter, hack,<br/>
Knew that he had a rider on his back.<br/>
<br/>
And now in this new field, with some applause,<br/>
    He clear&rsquo;d hedge, ditch, and double post, and rail,<br/>
And never craned, and made but few &lsquo;faux pas,&rsquo;<br/>
    And only fretted when the scent &rsquo;gan fail.<br/>
He broke, &rsquo;tis true, some statutes of the laws<br/>
    Of hunting&mdash;for the sagest youth is frail;<br/>
Rode o&rsquo;er the hounds, it may be, now and then,<br/>
And once o&rsquo;er several country gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
But on the whole, to general admiration<br/>
    He acquitted both himself and horse: the squires<br/>
Marvell&rsquo;d at merit of another nation;<br/>
    The boors cried &lsquo;Dang it? who &rsquo;d have thought it?&rsquo;&mdash;Sires,<br/>
The Nestors of the sporting generation,<br/>
    Swore praises, and recall&rsquo;d their former fires;<br/>
The huntsman&rsquo;s self relented to a grin,<br/>
And rated him almost a whipper-in.<br/>
<br/>
Such were his trophies&mdash;not of spear and shield,<br/>
    But leaps, and bursts, and sometimes foxes&rsquo; brushes;<br/>
Yet I must own,&mdash;although in this I yield<br/>
    To patriot sympathy a Briton&rsquo;s blushes,&mdash;<br/>
He thought at heart like courtly Chesterfield,<br/>
    Who, after a long chase o&rsquo;er hills, dales, bushes,<br/>
And what not, though he rode beyond all price,<br/>
Ask&rsquo;d next day, &lsquo;If men ever hunted twice?&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
He also had a quality uncommon<br/>
    To early risers after a long chase,<br/>
Who wake in winter ere the cock can summon<br/>
    December&rsquo;s drowsy day to his dull race,&mdash;<br/>
A quality agreeable to woman,<br/>
    When her soft, liquid words run on apace,<br/>
Who likes a listener, whether saint or sinner,&mdash;<br/>
He did not fall asleep just after dinner;<br/>
<br/>
But, light and airy, stood on the alert,<br/>
    And shone in the best part of dialogue,<br/>
By humouring always what they might assert,<br/>
    And listening to the topics most in vogue;<br/>
Now grave, now gay, but never dull or pert;<br/>
    And smiling but in secret&mdash;cunning rogue!<br/>
He ne&rsquo;er presumed to make an error clearer;&mdash;<br/>
In short, there never was a better hearer.<br/>
<br/>
And then he danced;&mdash;all foreigners excel<br/>
    The serious Angles in the eloquence<br/>
Of pantomime;&mdash;he danced, I say, right well,<br/>
    With emphasis, and also with good sense&mdash;<br/>
A thing in footing indispensable;<br/>
    He danced without theatrical pretence,<br/>
Not like a ballet-master in the van<br/>
Of his drill&rsquo;d nymphs, but like a gentleman.<br/>
<br/>
Chaste were his steps, each kept within due bound,<br/>
    And elegance was sprinkled o&rsquo;er his figure;<br/>
Like swift Camilla, he scarce skimm&rsquo;d the ground,<br/>
    And rather held in than put forth his vigour;<br/>
And then he had an ear for music&rsquo;s sound,<br/>
    Which might defy a crotchet critic&rsquo;s rigour.<br/>
Such classic pas&mdash;sans flaws&mdash;set off our hero,<br/>
He glanced like a personified Bolero;<br/>
<br/>
Or, like a flying Hour before Aurora,<br/>
    In Guido&rsquo;s famous fresco which alone<br/>
Is worth a tour to Rome, although no more a<br/>
    Remnant were there of the old world&rsquo;s sole throne.<br/>
The &lsquo;tout ensemble&rsquo; of his movements wore a<br/>
    Grace of the soft ideal, seldom shown,<br/>
And ne&rsquo;er to be described; for to the dolour<br/>
Of bards and prosers, words are void of colour.<br/>
<br/>
No marvel then he was a favourite;<br/>
    A full-grown Cupid, very much admired;<br/>
A little spoilt, but by no means so quite;<br/>
    At least he kept his vanity retired.<br/>
Such was his tact, he could alike delight<br/>
    The chaste, and those who are not so much inspired.<br/>
The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke, who loved &lsquo;tracasserie,&rsquo;<br/>
Began to treat him with some small &lsquo;agacerie.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
She was a fine and somewhat full-blown blonde,<br/>
    Desirable, distinguish&rsquo;d, celebrated<br/>
For several winters in the grand, grand monde.<br/>
    I&rsquo;d rather not say what might be related<br/>
Of her exploits, for this were ticklish ground;<br/>
    Besides there might be falsehood in what &rsquo;s stated:<br/>
Her late performance had been a dead set<br/>
At Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.<br/>
<br/>
This noble personage began to look<br/>
    A little black upon this new flirtation;<br/>
But such small licences must lovers brook,<br/>
    Mere freedoms of the female corporation.<br/>
Woe to the man who ventures a rebuke!<br/>
    &rsquo;Twill but precipitate a situation<br/>
Extremely disagreeable, but common<br/>
To calculators when they count on woman.<br/>
<br/>
The circle smiled, then whisper&rsquo;d, and then sneer&rsquo;d;<br/>
    The Misses bridled, and the matrons frown&rsquo;d;<br/>
Some hoped things might not turn out as they fear&rsquo;d;<br/>
    Some would not deem such women could be found;<br/>
Some ne&rsquo;er believed one half of what they heard;<br/>
    Some look&rsquo;d perplex&rsquo;d, and others look&rsquo;d profound;<br/>
And several pitied with sincere regret<br/>
Poor Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.<br/>
<br/>
But what is odd, none ever named the duke,<br/>
    Who, one might think, was something in the affair;<br/>
True, he was absent, and, &rsquo;twas rumour&rsquo;d, took<br/>
    But small concern about the when, or where,<br/>
Or what his consort did: if he could brook<br/>
    Her gaieties, none had a right to stare:<br/>
Theirs was that best of unions, past all doubt,<br/>
Which never meets, and therefore can&rsquo;t fall out.<br/>
<br/>
But, oh! that I should ever pen so sad a line!<br/>
    Fired with an abstract love of virtue, she,<br/>
My Dian of the Ephesians, Lady Adeline,<br/>
    Began to think the duchess&rsquo; conduct free;<br/>
Regretting much that she had chosen so bad a line,<br/>
    And waxing chiller in her courtesy,<br/>
Look&rsquo;d grave and pale to see her friend&rsquo;s fragility,<br/>
For which most friends reserve their sensibility.<br/>
<br/>
There&rsquo;s nought in this bad world like sympathy:<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis so becoming to the soul and face,<br/>
Sets to soft music the harmonious sigh,<br/>
    And robes sweet friendship in a Brussels lace.<br/>
Without a friend, what were humanity,<br/>
    To hunt our errors up with a good grace?<br/>
Consoling us with&mdash;&lsquo;Would you had thought twice!<br/>
Ah, if you had but follow&rsquo;d my advice!&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
O job! you had two friends: one &rsquo;s quite enough,<br/>
    Especially when we are ill at ease;<br/>
They are but bad pilots when the weather &rsquo;s rough,<br/>
    Doctors less famous for their cures than fees.<br/>
Let no man grumble when his friends fall off,<br/>
    As they will do like leaves at the first breeze:<br/>
When your affairs come round, one way or t&rsquo; other,<br/>
Go to the coffee-house, and take another.<br/>
<br/>
But this is not my maxim: had it been,<br/>
    Some heart-aches had been spared me: yet I care not&mdash;<br/>
I would not be a tortoise in his screen<br/>
    Of stubborn shell, which waves and weather wear not.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis better on the whole to have felt and seen<br/>
    That which humanity may bear, or bear not:<br/>
&rsquo;Twill teach discernment to the sensitive,<br/>
And not to pour their ocean in a sieve.<br/>
<br/>
Of all the horrid, hideous notes of woe,<br/>
    Sadder than owl-songs or the midnight blast,<br/>
Is that portentous phrase, &lsquo;I told you so,&rsquo;<br/>
    Utter&rsquo;d by friends, those prophets of the past,<br/>
Who, &rsquo;stead of saying what you now should do,<br/>
    Own they foresaw that you would fall at last,<br/>
And solace your slight lapse &rsquo;gainst &lsquo;bonos mores,&rsquo;<br/>
With a long memorandum of old stories.<br/>
<br/>
The Lady Adeline&rsquo;s serene severity<br/>
    Was not confined to feeling for her friend,<br/>
Whose fame she rather doubted with posterity,<br/>
    Unless her habits should begin to mend:<br/>
But Juan also shared in her austerity,<br/>
    But mix&rsquo;d with pity, pure as e&rsquo;er was penn&rsquo;d:<br/>
His inexperience moved her gentle ruth,<br/>
And (as her junior by six weeks) his youth.<br/>
<br/>
These forty days&rsquo; advantage of her years&mdash;<br/>
    And hers were those which can face calculation,<br/>
Boldly referring to the list of peers<br/>
    And noble births, nor dread the enumeration&mdash;<br/>
Gave her a right to have maternal fears<br/>
    For a young gentleman&rsquo;s fit education,<br/>
Though she was far from that leap year, whose leap,<br/>
In female dates, strikes Time all of a heap.<br/>
<br/>
This may be fix&rsquo;d at somewhere before thirty&mdash;<br/>
    Say seven-and-twenty; for I never knew<br/>
The strictest in chronology and virtue<br/>
    Advance beyond, while they could pass for new.<br/>
O Time! why dost not pause? Thy scythe, so dirty<br/>
    With rust, should surely cease to hack and hew.<br/>
Reset it; shave more smoothly, also slower,<br/>
If but to keep thy credit as a mower.<br/>
<br/>
But Adeline was far from that ripe age,<br/>
    Whose ripeness is but bitter at the best:<br/>
&rsquo;Twas rather her experience made her sage,<br/>
    For she had seen the world and stood its test,<br/>
As I have said in&mdash;I forget what page;<br/>
    My Muse despises reference, as you have guess&rsquo;d<br/>
By this time;&mdash;but strike six from seven-and-twenty,<br/>
And you will find her sum of years in plenty.<br/>
<br/>
At sixteen she came out; presented, vaunted,<br/>
    She put all coronets into commotion:<br/>
At seventeen, too, the world was still enchanted<br/>
    With the new Venus of their brilliant ocean:<br/>
At eighteen, though below her feet still panted<br/>
    A hecatomb of suitors with devotion,<br/>
She had consented to create again<br/>
That Adam, call&rsquo;d &lsquo;The happiest of men.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Since then she had sparkled through three glowing winters,<br/>
    Admired, adored; but also so correct,<br/>
That she had puzzled all the acutest hinters,<br/>
    Without the apparel of being circumspect:<br/>
They could not even glean the slightest splinters<br/>
    From off the marble, which had no defect.<br/>
She had also snatch&rsquo;d a moment since her marriage<br/>
To bear a son and heir&mdash;and one miscarriage.<br/>
<br/>
Fondly the wheeling fire-flies flew around her,<br/>
    Those little glitterers of the London night;<br/>
But none of these possess&rsquo;d a sting to wound her&mdash;<br/>
    She was a pitch beyond a coxcomb&rsquo;s flight.<br/>
Perhaps she wish&rsquo;d an aspirant profounder;<br/>
    But whatsoe&rsquo;er she wish&rsquo;d, she acted right;<br/>
And whether coldness, pride, or virtue dignify<br/>
A woman, so she &rsquo;s good, what does it signify?<br/>
<br/>
I hate a motive, like a lingering bottle<br/>
    Which with the landlord makes too long a stand,<br/>
Leaving all-claretless the unmoisten&rsquo;d throttle,<br/>
    Especially with politics on hand;<br/>
I hate it, as I hate a drove of cattle,<br/>
    Who whirl the dust as simooms whirl the sand;<br/>
I hate it, as I hate an argument,<br/>
A laureate&rsquo;s ode, or servile peer&rsquo;s &lsquo;content.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis sad to hack into the roots of things,<br/>
    They are so much intertwisted with the earth;<br/>
So that the branch a goodly verdure flings,<br/>
    I reck not if an acorn gave it birth.<br/>
To trace all actions to their secret springs<br/>
    Would make indeed some melancholy mirth;<br/>
But this is not at present my concern,<br/>
And I refer you to wise Oxenstiern.<br/>
<br/>
With the kind view of saving an eclat,<br/>
    Both to the duchess and diplomatist,<br/>
The Lady Adeline, as soon &rsquo;s she saw<br/>
    That Juan was unlikely to resist<br/>
(For foreigners don&rsquo;t know that a faux pas<br/>
    In England ranks quite on a different list<br/>
From those of other lands unblest with juries,<br/>
Whose verdict for such sin a certain cure is);&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
The Lady Adeline resolved to take<br/>
    Such measures as she thought might best impede<br/>
The farther progress of this sad mistake.<br/>
    She thought with some simplicity indeed;<br/>
But innocence is bold even at the stake,<br/>
    And simple in the world, and doth not need<br/>
Nor use those palisades by dames erected,<br/>
Whose virtue lies in never being detected.<br/>
<br/>
It was not that she fear&rsquo;d the very worst:<br/>
    His Grace was an enduring, married man,<br/>
And was not likely all at once to burst<br/>
    Into a scene, and swell the clients&rsquo; clan<br/>
Of Doctors&rsquo; Commons: but she dreaded first<br/>
    The magic of her Grace&rsquo;s talisman,<br/>
And next a quarrel (as he seem&rsquo;d to fret)<br/>
With Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.<br/>
<br/>
Her Grace, too, pass&rsquo;d for being an intrigante,<br/>
    And somewhat mechante in her amorous sphere;<br/>
One of those pretty, precious plagues, which haunt<br/>
    A lover with caprices soft and dear,<br/>
That like to make a quarrel, when they can&rsquo;t<br/>
    Find one, each day of the delightful year;<br/>
Bewitching, torturing, as they freeze or glow,<br/>
And&mdash;what is worst of all&mdash;won&rsquo;t let you go:<br/>
<br/>
The sort of thing to turn a young man&rsquo;s head,<br/>
    Or make a Werter of him in the end.<br/>
No wonder then a purer soul should dread<br/>
    This sort of chaste liaison for a friend;<br/>
It were much better to be wed or dead,<br/>
    Than wear a heart a woman loves to rend.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis best to pause, and think, ere you rush on,<br/>
If that a &lsquo;bonne fortune&rsquo; be really &lsquo;bonne.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
And first, in the o&rsquo;erflowing of her heart,<br/>
    Which really knew or thought it knew no guile,<br/>
She call&rsquo;d her husband now and then apart,<br/>
    And bade him counsel Juan. With a smile<br/>
Lord Henry heard her plans of artless art<br/>
    To wean Don Juan from the siren&rsquo;s wile;<br/>
And answer&rsquo;d, like a statesman or a prophet,<br/>
In such guise that she could make nothing of it.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, he said, &lsquo;he never interfered<br/>
    In any body&rsquo;s business but the king&rsquo;s:&rsquo;<br/>
Next, that &lsquo;he never judged from what appear&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Without strong reason, of those sort of things:&rsquo;<br/>
Thirdly, that &lsquo;Juan had more brain than beard,<br/>
    And was not to be held in leading strings;&rsquo;<br/>
And fourthly, what need hardly be said twice,<br/>
&lsquo;That good but rarely came from good advice.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
And, therefore, doubtless to approve the truth<br/>
    Of the last axiom, he advised his spouse<br/>
To leave the parties to themselves, forsooth&mdash;<br/>
    At least as far as bienseance allows:<br/>
That time would temper Juan&rsquo;s faults of youth;<br/>
    That young men rarely made monastic vows;<br/>
That opposition only more attaches&mdash;<br/>
But here a messenger brought in despatches:<br/>
<br/>
And being of the council call&rsquo;d &lsquo;the Privy,&rsquo;<br/>
    Lord Henry walk&rsquo;d into his cabinet,<br/>
To furnish matter for some future Livy<br/>
    To tell how he reduced the nation&rsquo;s debt;<br/>
And if their full contents I do not give ye,<br/>
    It is because I do not know them yet;<br/>
But I shall add them in a brief appendix,<br/>
To come between mine epic and its index.<br/>
<br/>
But ere he went, he added a slight hint,<br/>
    Another gentle common-place or two,<br/>
Such as are coin&rsquo;d in conversation&rsquo;s mint,<br/>
    And pass, for want of better, though not new:<br/>
Then broke his packet, to see what was in &rsquo;t,<br/>
    And having casually glanced it through,<br/>
Retired; and, as went out, calmly kiss&rsquo;d her,<br/>
Less like a young wife than an aged sister.<br/>
<br/>
He was a cold, good, honourable man,<br/>
    Proud of his birth, and proud of every thing;<br/>
A goodly spirit for a state divan,<br/>
    A figure fit to walk before a king;<br/>
Tall, stately, form&rsquo;d to lead the courtly van<br/>
    On birthdays, glorious with a star and string;<br/>
The very model of a chamberlain&mdash;<br/>
And such I mean to make him when I reign.<br/>
<br/>
But there was something wanting on the whole&mdash;<br/>
    I don&rsquo;t know what, and therefore cannot tell&mdash;<br/>
Which pretty women&mdash;the sweet souls!&mdash;call soul.<br/>
    Certes it was not body; he was well<br/>
Proportion&rsquo;d, as a poplar or a pole,<br/>
    A handsome man, that human miracle;<br/>
And in each circumstance of love or war<br/>
Had still preserved his perpendicular.<br/>
<br/>
Still there was something wanting, as I&rsquo;ve said&mdash;<br/>
    That undefinable &lsquo;Je ne scais quoi,&rsquo;<br/>
Which, for what I know, may of yore have led<br/>
    To Homer&rsquo;s Iliad, since it drew to Troy<br/>
The Greek Eve, Helen, from the Spartan&rsquo;s bed;<br/>
    Though on the whole, no doubt, the Dardan boy<br/>
Was much inferior to King Menelaus:&mdash;<br/>
But thus it is some women will betray us.<br/>
<br/>
There is an awkward thing which much perplexes,<br/>
    Unless like wise Tiresias we had proved<br/>
By turns the difference of the several sexes;<br/>
    Neither can show quite how they would be loved.<br/>
The sensual for a short time but connects us,<br/>
    The sentimental boasts to be unmoved;<br/>
But both together form a kind of centaur,<br/>
Upon whose back &rsquo;tis better not to venture.<br/>
<br/>
A something all-sufficient for the heart<br/>
    Is that for which the sex are always seeking:<br/>
But how to fill up that same vacant part?<br/>
    There lies the rub&mdash;and this they are but weak in.<br/>
Frail mariners afloat without a chart,<br/>
    They run before the wind through high seas breaking;<br/>
And when they have made the shore through every shock,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis odd, or odds, it may turn out a rock.<br/>
<br/>
There is a flower call&rsquo;d &lsquo;Love in Idleness,&rsquo;<br/>
    For which see Shakspeare&rsquo;s everblooming garden;&mdash;<br/>
I will not make his great description less,<br/>
    And beg his British godship&rsquo;s humble pardon,<br/>
If in my extremity of rhyme&rsquo;s distress,<br/>
    I touch a single leaf where he is warden;&mdash;<br/>
But though the flower is different, with the French<br/>
Or Swiss Rousseau, cry &lsquo;Voila la Pervenche!&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Eureka! I have found it! What I mean<br/>
    To say is, not that love is idleness,<br/>
But that in love such idleness has been<br/>
    An accessory, as I have cause to guess.<br/>
Hard labour&rsquo;s an indifferent go-between;<br/>
    Your men of business are not apt to express<br/>
Much passion, since the merchant-ship, the Argo,<br/>
Convey&rsquo;d Medea as her supercargo.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Beatus ille procul!&rsquo; from &lsquo;negotiis,&rsquo;<br/>
    Saith Horace; the great little poet &rsquo;s wrong;<br/>
His other maxim, &lsquo;Noscitur a sociis,&rsquo;<br/>
    Is much more to the purpose of his song;<br/>
Though even that were sometimes too ferocious,<br/>
    Unless good company be kept too long;<br/>
But, in his teeth, whate&rsquo;er their state or station,<br/>
Thrice happy they who have an occupation!<br/>
<br/>
Adam exchanged his Paradise for ploughing,<br/>
    Eve made up millinery with fig leaves&mdash;<br/>
The earliest knowledge from the tree so knowing,<br/>
    As far as I know, that the church receives:<br/>
And since that time it need not cost much showing,<br/>
    That many of the ills o&rsquo;er which man grieves,<br/>
And still more women, spring from not employing<br/>
Some hours to make the remnant worth enjoying.<br/>
<br/>
And hence high life is oft a dreary void,<br/>
    A rack of pleasures, where we must invent<br/>
A something wherewithal to be annoy&rsquo;d.<br/>
    Bards may sing what they please about Content;<br/>
Contented, when translated, means but cloy&rsquo;d;<br/>
    And hence arise the woes of sentiment,<br/>
Blue devils, and blue-stockings, and romances<br/>
Reduced to practice, and perform&rsquo;d like dances.<br/>
<br/>
I do declare, upon an affidavit,<br/>
    Romances I ne&rsquo;er read like those I have seen;<br/>
Nor, if unto the world I ever gave it,<br/>
    Would some believe that such a tale had been:<br/>
But such intent I never had, nor have it;<br/>
    Some truths are better kept behind a screen,<br/>
Especially when they would look like lies;<br/>
I therefore deal in generalities.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;An oyster may be cross&rsquo;d in love,&rsquo;&mdash;and why?<br/>
    Because he mopeth idly in his shell,<br/>
And heaves a lonely subterraqueous sigh,<br/>
    Much as a monk may do within his cell:<br/>
And a-propos of monks, their piety<br/>
    With sloth hath found it difficult to dwell;<br/>
Those vegetables of the Catholic creed<br/>
Are apt exceedingly to run to seed.<br/>
<br/>
O Wilberforce! thou man of black renown,<br/>
    Whose merit none enough can sing or say,<br/>
Thou hast struck one immense Colossus down,<br/>
    Thou moral Washington of Africa!<br/>
But there&rsquo;s another little thing, I own,<br/>
    Which you should perpetrate some summer&rsquo;s day,<br/>
And set the other halt of earth to rights;<br/>
You have freed the blacks&mdash;now pray shut up the whites.<br/>
<br/>
Shut up the bald-coot bully Alexander!<br/>
    Ship off the Holy Three to Senegal;<br/>
Teach them that &lsquo;sauce for goose is sauce for gander,&rsquo;<br/>
    And ask them how they like to be in thrall?<br/>
Shut up each high heroic salamander,<br/>
    Who eats fire gratis (since the pay &rsquo;s but small);<br/>
Shut up&mdash;no, not the King, but the Pavilion,<br/>
Or else &rsquo;twill cost us all another million.<br/>
<br/>
Shut up the world at large, let Bedlam out;<br/>
    And you will be perhaps surprised to find<br/>
All things pursue exactly the same route,<br/>
    As now with those of soi-disant sound mind.<br/>
This I could prove beyond a single doubt,<br/>
    Were there a jot of sense among mankind;<br/>
But till that point d&rsquo;appui is found, alas!<br/>
Like Archimedes, I leave earth as &rsquo;twas.<br/>
<br/>
Our gentle Adeline had one defect&mdash;<br/>
    Her heart was vacant, though a splendid mansion;<br/>
Her conduct had been perfectly correct,<br/>
    As she had seen nought claiming its expansion.<br/>
A wavering spirit may be easier wreck&rsquo;d,<br/>
    Because &rsquo;tis frailer, doubtless, than a stanch one;<br/>
But when the latter works its own undoing,<br/>
Its inner crash is like an earthquake&rsquo;s ruin.<br/>
<br/>
She loved her lord, or thought so; but that love<br/>
    Cost her an effort, which is a sad toil,<br/>
The stone of Sisyphus, if once we move<br/>
    Our feelings &rsquo;gainst the nature of the soil.<br/>
She had nothing to complain of, or reprove,<br/>
    No bickerings, no connubial turmoil:<br/>
Their union was a model to behold,<br/>
Serene and noble,&mdash;conjugal, but cold.<br/>
<br/>
There was no great disparity of years,<br/>
    Though much in temper; but they never clash&rsquo;d:<br/>
They moved like stars united in their spheres,<br/>
    Or like the Rhone by Leman&rsquo;s waters wash&rsquo;d,<br/>
Where mingled and yet separate appears<br/>
    The river from the lake, all bluely dash&rsquo;d<br/>
Through the serene and placid glassy deep,<br/>
Which fain would lull its river-child to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Now when she once had ta&rsquo;en an interest<br/>
    In any thing, however she might flatter<br/>
Herself that her intentions were the best,<br/>
    Intense intentions are a dangerous matter:<br/>
Impressions were much stronger than she guess&rsquo;d,<br/>
    And gather&rsquo;d as they run like growing water<br/>
Upon her mind; the more so, as her breast<br/>
Was not at first too readily impress&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
But when it was, she had that lurking demon<br/>
    Of double nature, and thus doubly named&mdash;<br/>
Firmness yclept in heroes, kings, and seamen,<br/>
    That is, when they succeed; but greatly blamed<br/>
As obstinacy, both in men and women,<br/>
    Whene&rsquo;er their triumph pales, or star is tamed:&mdash;<br/>
And &rsquo;twill perplex the casuist in morality<br/>
To fix the due bounds of this dangerous quality.<br/>
<br/>
Had Buonaparte won at Waterloo,<br/>
    It had been firmness; now &rsquo;tis pertinacity:<br/>
Must the event decide between the two?<br/>
    I leave it to your people of sagacity<br/>
To draw the line between the false and true,<br/>
    If such can e&rsquo;er be drawn by man&rsquo;s capacity:<br/>
My business is with Lady Adeline,<br/>
Who in her way too was a heroine.<br/>
<br/>
She knew not her own heart; then how should I?<br/>
    I think not she was then in love with Juan:<br/>
If so, she would have had the strength to fly<br/>
    The wild sensation, unto her a new one:<br/>
She merely felt a common sympathy<br/>
    (I will not say it was a false or true one)<br/>
In him, because she thought he was in danger,&mdash;<br/>
Her husband&rsquo;s friend, her own, young, and a stranger,<br/>
<br/>
She was, or thought she was, his friend&mdash;and this<br/>
    Without the farce of friendship, or romance<br/>
Of Platonism, which leads so oft amiss<br/>
    Ladies who have studied friendship but in France,<br/>
Or Germany, where people purely kiss.<br/>
    To thus much Adeline would not advance;<br/>
But of such friendship as man&rsquo;s may to man be<br/>
She was as capable as woman can be.<br/>
<br/>
No doubt the secret influence of the sex<br/>
    Will there, as also in the ties of blood,<br/>
An innocent predominance annex,<br/>
    And tune the concord to a finer mood.<br/>
If free from passion, which all friendship checks,<br/>
    And your true feelings fully understood,<br/>
No friend like to a woman earth discovers,<br/>
So that you have not been nor will be lovers.<br/>
<br/>
Love bears within its breast the very germ<br/>
    Of change; and how should this be otherwise?<br/>
That violent things more quickly find a term<br/>
    Is shown through nature&rsquo;s whole analogies;<br/>
And how should the most fierce of all be firm?<br/>
    Would you have endless lightning in the skies?<br/>
Methinks Love&rsquo;s very title says enough:<br/>
How should &lsquo;the tender passion&rsquo; e&rsquo;er be tough?<br/>
<br/>
Alas! by all experience, seldom yet<br/>
    (I merely quote what I have heard from many)<br/>
Had lovers not some reason to regret<br/>
    The passion which made Solomon a zany.<br/>
I&rsquo;ve also seen some wives (not to forget<br/>
    The marriage state, the best or worst of any)<br/>
Who were the very paragons of wives,<br/>
Yet made the misery of at least two lives.<br/>
<br/>
I&rsquo;ve also seen some female friends ( &rsquo;tis odd,<br/>
    But true&mdash;as, if expedient, I could prove)<br/>
That faithful were through thick and thin, abroad,<br/>
    At home, far more than ever yet was Love&mdash;<br/>
Who did not quit me when Oppression trod<br/>
    Upon me; whom no scandal could remove;<br/>
Who fought, and fight, in absence, too, my battles,<br/>
Despite the snake Society&rsquo;s loud rattles.<br/>
<br/>
Whether Don Juan and chaste Adeline<br/>
    Grew friends in this or any other sense,<br/>
Will be discuss&rsquo;d hereafter, I opine:<br/>
    At present I am glad of a pretence<br/>
To leave them hovering, as the effect is fine,<br/>
    And keeps the atrocious reader in suspense;<br/>
The surest way for ladies and for books<br/>
To bait their tender, or their tenter, hooks.<br/>
<br/>
Whether they rode, or walk&rsquo;d, or studied Spanish<br/>
    To read Don Quixote in the original,<br/>
A pleasure before which all others vanish;<br/>
    Whether their talk was of the kind call&rsquo;d &lsquo;small,&rsquo;<br/>
Or serious, are the topics I must banish<br/>
    To the next Canto; where perhaps I shall<br/>
Say something to the purpose, and display<br/>
Considerable talent in my way.<br/>
<br/>
Above all, I beg all men to forbear<br/>
    Anticipating aught about the matter:<br/>
They&rsquo;ll only make mistakes about the fair,<br/>
    And Juan too, especially the latter.<br/>
And I shall take a much more serious air<br/>
    Than I have yet done, in this epic satire.<br/>
It is not clear that Adeline and Juan<br/>
Will fall; but if they do, &rsquo;twill be their ruin.<br/>
<br/>
But great things spring from little:&mdash;Would you think,<br/>
    That in our youth, as dangerous a passion<br/>
As e&rsquo;er brought man and woman to the brink<br/>
    Of ruin, rose from such a slight occasion,<br/>
As few would ever dream could form the link<br/>
    Of such a sentimental situation?<br/>
You&rsquo;ll never guess, I&rsquo;ll bet you millions, milliards&mdash;<br/>
It all sprung from a harmless game at billiards.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis strange,&mdash;but true; for truth is always strange;<br/>
    Stranger than fiction; if it could be told,<br/>
How much would novels gain by the exchange!<br/>
    How differently the world would men behold!<br/>
How oft would vice and virtue places change!<br/>
    The new world would be nothing to the old,<br/>
If some Columbus of the moral seas<br/>
Would show mankind their souls&rsquo; antipodes.<br/>
<br/>
What &lsquo;antres vast and deserts idle&rsquo; then<br/>
    Would be discover&rsquo;d in the human soul!<br/>
What icebergs in the hearts of mighty men,<br/>
    With self-love in the centre as their pole!<br/>
What Anthropophagi are nine of ten<br/>
    Of those who hold the kingdoms in control<br/>
Were things but only call&rsquo;d by their right name,<br/>
Caesar himself would be ashamed of fame.<br/>

CANTO THE FIFTEENTH.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
Ah!&mdash;What should follow slips from my reflection;<br/>
    Whatever follows ne&rsquo;ertheless may be<br/>
As <i>à propos</i> of hope or retrospection,<br/>
    As though the lurking thought had follow&rsquo;d free.<br/>
All present life is but an interjection,<br/>
    An &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; or &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; of joy or misery,<br/>
Or a &lsquo;Ha! ha!&rsquo; or &lsquo;Bah!&rsquo;&mdash;a yawn, or &lsquo;Pooh!&rsquo;<br/>
Of which perhaps the latter is most true.<br/>
<br/>
But, more or less, the whole &rsquo;s a syncope<br/>
    Or a singultus&mdash;emblems of emotion,<br/>
The grand antithesis to great ennui,<br/>
    Wherewith we break our bubbles on the ocean,&mdash;<br/>
That watery outline of eternity,<br/>
    Or miniature at least, as is my notion,<br/>
Which ministers unto the soul&rsquo;s delight,<br/>
In seeing matters which are out of sight.<br/>
<br/>
But all are better than the sigh supprest,<br/>
    Corroding in the cavern of the heart,<br/>
Making the countenance a masque of rest,<br/>
    And turning human nature to an art.<br/>
Few men dare show their thoughts of worst or best;<br/>
    Dissimulation always sets apart<br/>
A corner for herself; and therefore fiction<br/>
Is that which passes with least contradiction.<br/>
<br/>
Ah! who can tell? Or rather, who can not<br/>
    Remember, without telling, passion&rsquo;s errors?<br/>
The drainer of oblivion, even the sot,<br/>
    Hath got blue devils for his morning mirrors:<br/>
What though on Lethe&rsquo;s stream he seem to float,<br/>
    He cannot sink his tremors or his terrors;<br/>
The ruby glass that shakes within his hand<br/>
Leaves a sad sediment of Time&rsquo;s worst sand.<br/>
<br/>
And as for love&mdash;O love!&mdash;We will proceed.<br/>
    The Lady Adeline Amundeville,<br/>
A pretty name as one would wish to read,<br/>
    Must perch harmonious on my tuneful quill.<br/>
There&rsquo;s music in the sighing of a reed;<br/>
    There&rsquo;s music in the gushing of a rill;<br/>
There&rsquo;s music in all things, if men had ears:<br/>
Their earth is but an echo of the spheres.<br/>
<br/>
The Lady Adeline, right honourable;<br/>
    And honour&rsquo;d, ran a risk of growing less so;<br/>
For few of the soft sex are very stable<br/>
    In their resolves&mdash;alas! that I should say so!<br/>
They differ as wine differs from its label,<br/>
    When once decanted;&mdash;I presume to guess so,<br/>
But will not swear: yet both upon occasion,<br/>
Till old, may undergo adulteration.<br/>
<br/>
But Adeline was of the purest vintage,<br/>
    The unmingled essence of the grape; and yet<br/>
Bright as a new Napoleon from its mintage,<br/>
    Or glorious as a diamond richly set;<br/>
A page where Time should hesitate to print age,<br/>
    And for which Nature might forego her debt&mdash;<br/>
Sole creditor whose process doth involve in &rsquo;t<br/>
The luck of finding every body solvent.<br/>
<br/>
O Death! thou dunnest of all duns! thou daily<br/>
    Knockest at doors, at first with modest tap,<br/>
Like a meek tradesman when, approaching palely,<br/>
    Some splendid debtor he would take by sap:<br/>
But oft denied, as patience &rsquo;gins to fail, he<br/>
    Advances with exasperated rap,<br/>
And (if let in) insists, in terms unhandsome,<br/>
On ready money, or &lsquo;a draft on Ransom.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Whate&rsquo;er thou takest, spare a while poor Beauty!<br/>
    She is so rare, and thou hast so much prey.<br/>
What though she now and then may slip from duty,<br/>
    The more &rsquo;s the reason why you ought to stay.<br/>
Gaunt Gourmand! with whole nations for your booty,<br/>
    You should be civil in a modest way:<br/>
Suppress, then, some slight feminine diseases,<br/>
And take as many heroes as Heaven pleases.<br/>
<br/>
Fair Adeline, the more ingenuous<br/>
    Where she was interested (as was said),<br/>
Because she was not apt, like some of us,<br/>
    To like too readily, or too high bred<br/>
To show it (points we need not now discuss)&mdash;<br/>
    Would give up artlessly both heart and head<br/>
Unto such feelings as seem&rsquo;d innocent,<br/>
For objects worthy of the sentiment.<br/>
<br/>
Some parts of Juan&rsquo;s history, which Rumour,<br/>
    That live gazette, had scatter&rsquo;d to disfigure,<br/>
She had heard; but women hear with more good humour<br/>
    Such aberrations than we men of rigour:<br/>
Besides, his conduct, since in England, grew more<br/>
    Strict, and his mind assumed a manlier vigour;<br/>
Because he had, like Alcibiades,<br/>
The art of living in all climes with ease.<br/>
<br/>
His manner was perhaps the more seductive,<br/>
    Because he ne&rsquo;er seem&rsquo;d anxious to seduce;<br/>
Nothing affected, studied, or constructive<br/>
    Of coxcombry or conquest: no abuse<br/>
Of his attractions marr&rsquo;d the fair perspective,<br/>
    To indicate a Cupidon broke loose,<br/>
And seem to say, &lsquo;Resist us if you can&rsquo;-<br/>
Which makes a dandy while it spoils a man.<br/>
<br/>
They are wrong&mdash;that &rsquo;s not the way to set about it;<br/>
    As, if they told the truth, could well be shown.<br/>
But, right or wrong, Don Juan was without it;<br/>
    In fact, his manner was his own alone;<br/>
Sincere he was&mdash;at least you could not doubt it,<br/>
    In listening merely to his voice&rsquo;s tone.<br/>
The devil hath not in all his quiver&rsquo;s choice<br/>
An arrow for the heart like a sweet voice.<br/>
<br/>
By nature soft, his whole address held off<br/>
    Suspicion: though not timid, his regard<br/>
Was such as rather seem&rsquo;d to keep aloof,<br/>
    To shield himself than put you on your guard:<br/>
Perhaps &rsquo;twas hardly quite assured enough,<br/>
    But modesty &rsquo;s at times its own reward,<br/>
Like virtue; and the absence of pretension<br/>
Will go much farther than there&rsquo;s need to mention.<br/>
<br/>
Serene, accomplish&rsquo;d, cheerful but not loud;<br/>
    Insinuating without insinuation;<br/>
Observant of the foibles of the crowd,<br/>
    Yet ne&rsquo;er betraying this in conversation;<br/>
Proud with the proud, yet courteously proud,<br/>
    So as to make them feel he knew his station<br/>
And theirs:&mdash;without a struggle for priority,<br/>
He neither brook&rsquo;d nor claim&rsquo;d superiority.<br/>
<br/>
That is, with men: with women he was what<br/>
    They pleased to make or take him for; and their<br/>
Imagination &rsquo;s quite enough for that:<br/>
    So that the outline &rsquo;s tolerably fair,<br/>
They fill the canvas up&mdash;and &lsquo;verbum sat.&rsquo;<br/>
    If once their phantasies be brought to bear<br/>
Upon an object, whether sad or playful,<br/>
They can transfigure brighter than a Raphael.<br/>
<br/>
Adeline, no deep judge of character,<br/>
    Was apt to add a colouring from her own:<br/>
&rsquo;Tis thus the good will amiably err,<br/>
    And eke the wise, as has been often shown.<br/>
Experience is the chief philosopher,<br/>
    But saddest when his science is well known:<br/>
And persecuted sages teach the schools<br/>
Their folly in forgetting there are fools.<br/>
<br/>
Was it not so, great Locke? and greater Bacon?<br/>
    Great Socrates? And thou, Diviner still,<br/>
Whose lot it is by man to be mistaken,<br/>
    And thy pure creed made sanction of all ill?<br/>
Redeeming worlds to be by bigots shaken,<br/>
    How was thy toil rewarded? We might fill<br/>
Volumes with similar sad illustrations,<br/>
But leave them to the conscience of the nations.<br/>
<br/>
I perch upon an humbler promontory,<br/>
    Amidst life&rsquo;s infinite variety:<br/>
With no great care for what is nicknamed glory,<br/>
    But speculating as I cast mine eye<br/>
On what may suit or may not suit my story,<br/>
    And never straining hard to versify,<br/>
I rattle on exactly as I&rsquo;d talk<br/>
With any body in a ride or walk.<br/>
<br/>
I don&rsquo;t know that there may be much ability<br/>
    Shown in this sort of desultory rhyme;<br/>
But there&rsquo;s a conversational facility,<br/>
    Which may round off an hour upon a time.<br/>
Of this I&rsquo;m sure at least, there&rsquo;s no servility<br/>
    In mine irregularity of chime,<br/>
Which rings what &rsquo;s uppermost of new or hoary,<br/>
Just as I feel the &lsquo;Improvvisatore.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Omnia vult belle Matho dicere&mdash;dic aliquando<br/>
    Et bene, dic neutrum, dic aliquando male.&rsquo;<br/>
The first is rather more than mortal can do;<br/>
    The second may be sadly done or gaily;<br/>
The third is still more difficult to stand to;<br/>
    The fourth we hear, and see, and say too, daily.<br/>
The whole together is what I could wish<br/>
To serve in this conundrum of a dish.<br/>
<br/>
A modest hope&mdash;but modesty &rsquo;s my forte,<br/>
    And pride my feeble:&mdash;let us ramble on.<br/>
I meant to make this poem very short,<br/>
    But now I can&rsquo;t tell where it may not run.<br/>
No doubt, if I had wish&rsquo; to pay my court<br/>
    To critics, or to hail the setting sun<br/>
Of tyranny of all kinds, my concision<br/>
Were more;&mdash;but I was born for opposition.<br/>
<br/>
But then &rsquo;tis mostly on the weaker side;<br/>
    So that I verily believe if they<br/>
Who now are basking in their full-blown pride<br/>
    Were shaken down, and &lsquo;dogs had had their day,&rsquo;<br/>
Though at the first I might perchance deride<br/>
    Their tumble, I should turn the other way,<br/>
And wax an ultra-royalist in loyalty,<br/>
Because I hate even democratic royalty.<br/>
<br/>
I think I should have made a decent spouse,<br/>
    If I had never proved the soft condition;<br/>
I think I should have made monastic vows,<br/>
    But for my own peculiar superstition:<br/>
&rsquo;Gainst rhyme I never should have knock&rsquo;d my brows,<br/>
    Nor broken my own head, nor that of Priscian,<br/>
Nor worn the motley mantle of a poet,<br/>
If some one had not told me to forego it.<br/>
<br/>
But &lsquo;laissez aller&rsquo;&mdash;knights and dames I sing,<br/>
    Such as the times may furnish. &rsquo;Tis a flight<br/>
Which seems at first to need no lofty wing,<br/>
    Plumed by Longinus or the Stagyrite:<br/>
The difficultly lies in colouring<br/>
    (Keeping the due proportions still in sight)<br/>
With nature manners which are artificial,<br/>
And rend&rsquo;ring general that which is especial.<br/>
<br/>
The difference is, that in the days of old<br/>
    Men made the manners; manners now make men&mdash;<br/>
Pinn&rsquo;d like a flock, and fleeced too in their fold,<br/>
    At least nine, and a ninth beside of ten.<br/>
Now this at all events must render cold<br/>
    Your writers, who must either draw again<br/>
Days better drawn before, or else assume<br/>
The present, with their common-place costume.<br/>
<br/>
We&rsquo;ll do our best to make the best on &rsquo;t:&mdash;March!<br/>
    March, my Muse! If you cannot fly, yet flutter;<br/>
And when you may not be sublime, be arch,<br/>
    Or starch, as are the edicts statesmen utter.<br/>
We surely may find something worth research:<br/>
    Columbus found a new world in a cutter,<br/>
Or brigantine, or pink, of no great tonnage,<br/>
While yet America was in her non-age.<br/>
<br/>
When Adeline, in all her growing sense<br/>
    Of Juan&rsquo;s merits and his situation,<br/>
Felt on the whole an interest intense,&mdash;<br/>
    Partly perhaps because a fresh sensation,<br/>
Or that he had an air of innocence,<br/>
    Which is for innocence a sad temptation,&mdash;<br/>
As women hate half measures, on the whole,<br/>
She &rsquo;gan to ponder how to save his soul.<br/>
<br/>
She had a good opinion of advice,<br/>
    Like all who give and eke receive it gratis,<br/>
For which small thanks are still the market price,<br/>
    Even where the article at highest rate is:<br/>
She thought upon the subject twice or thrice,<br/>
    And morally decided, the best state is<br/>
For morals, marriage; and this question carried,<br/>
She seriously advised him to get married.<br/>
<br/>
Juan replied, with all becoming deference,<br/>
    He had a predilection for that tie;<br/>
But that, at present, with immediate reference<br/>
    To his own circumstances, there might lie<br/>
Some difficulties, as in his own preference,<br/>
    Or that of her to whom he might apply:<br/>
That still he&rsquo;d wed with such or such a lady,<br/>
If that they were not married all already.<br/>
<br/>
Next to the making matches for herself,<br/>
    And daughters, brothers, sisters, kith or kin,<br/>
Arranging them like books on the same shelf,<br/>
    There&rsquo;s nothing women love to dabble in<br/>
More (like a stock-holder in growing pelf)<br/>
    Than match-making in general: &rsquo;tis no sin<br/>
Certes, but a preventative, and therefore<br/>
That is, no doubt, the only reason wherefore.<br/>
<br/>
But never yet (except of course a miss<br/>
    Unwed, or mistress never to be wed,<br/>
Or wed already, who object to this)<br/>
    Was there chaste dame who had not in her head<br/>
Some drama of the marriage unities,<br/>
    Observed as strictly both at board and bed<br/>
As those of Aristotle, though sometimes<br/>
They turn out melodrames or pantomimes.<br/>
<br/>
They generally have some only son,<br/>
    Some heir to a large property, some friend<br/>
Of an old family, some gay Sir john,<br/>
    Or grave Lord George, with whom perhaps might end<br/>
A line, and leave posterity undone,<br/>
    Unless a marriage was applied to mend<br/>
The prospect and their morals: and besides,<br/>
They have at hand a blooming glut of brides.<br/>
<br/>
From these they will be careful to select,<br/>
    For this an heiress, and for that a beauty;<br/>
For one a songstress who hath no defect,<br/>
    For t&rsquo; other one who promises much duty;<br/>
For this a lady no one can reject,<br/>
    Whose sole accomplishments were quite a booty;<br/>
A second for her excellent connections;<br/>
A third, because there can be no objections.<br/>
<br/>
When Rapp the Harmonist embargo&rsquo;d marriage<br/>
    In his harmonious settlement (which flourishes<br/>
Strangely enough as yet without miscarriage,<br/>
    Because it breeds no more mouths than it nourishes,<br/>
Without those sad expenses which disparage<br/>
    What Nature naturally most encourages)&mdash;<br/>
Why call&rsquo;d he &lsquo;Harmony&rsquo; a state sans wedlock?<br/>
Now here I&rsquo;ve got the preacher at a dead lock.<br/>
<br/>
Because he either meant to sneer at harmony<br/>
    Or marriage, by divorcing them thus oddly.<br/>
But whether reverend Rapp learn&rsquo;d this in Germany<br/>
    Or no, &rsquo;tis said his sect is rich and godly,<br/>
Pious and pure, beyond what I can term any<br/>
    Of ours, although they propagate more broadly.<br/>
My objection &rsquo;s to his title, not his ritual,<br/>
Although I wonder how it grew habitual.<br/>
<br/>
But Rapp is the reverse of zealous matrons,<br/>
    Who favour, malgre Malthus, generation&mdash;<br/>
Professors of that genial art, and patrons<br/>
    Of all the modest part of propagation;<br/>
Which after all at such a desperate rate runs,<br/>
    That half its produce tends to emigration,<br/>
That sad result of passions and potatoes&mdash;<br/>
Two weeds which pose our economic Catos.<br/>
<br/>
Had Adeline read Malthus? I can&rsquo;t tell;<br/>
    I wish she had: his book &rsquo;s the eleventh commandment,<br/>
Which says, &lsquo;Thou shalt not marry,&rsquo; unless well:<br/>
    This he (as far as I can understand) meant.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis not my purpose on his views to dwell<br/>
    Nor canvass what so &lsquo;eminent a hand&rsquo; meant;<br/>
But certes it conducts to lives ascetic,<br/>
Or turning marriage into arithmetic.<br/>
<br/>
But Adeline, who probably presumed<br/>
    That Juan had enough of maintenance,<br/>
Or separate maintenance, in case &rsquo;twas doom&rsquo;d&mdash;<br/>
    As on the whole it is an even chance<br/>
That bridegrooms, after they are fairly groom&rsquo;d,<br/>
    May retrograde a little in the dance<br/>
Of marriage (which might form a painter&rsquo;s fame,<br/>
Like Holbein&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dance of Death&rsquo;&mdash;but &rsquo;tis the same);&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
But Adeline determined Juan&rsquo;s wedding<br/>
    In her own mind, and that &rsquo;s enough for woman:<br/>
But then, with whom? There was the sage Miss Reading,<br/>
    Miss Raw, Miss Flaw, Miss Showman, and Miss Knowman.<br/>
And the two fair co-heiresses Giltbedding.<br/>
    She deem&rsquo;d his merits something more than common:<br/>
All these were unobjectionable matches,<br/>
And might go on, if well wound up, like watches.<br/>
<br/>
There was Miss Millpond, smooth as summer&rsquo;s sea,<br/>
    That usual paragon, an only daughter,<br/>
Who seem&rsquo;d the cream of equanimity<br/>
    Till skimm&rsquo;d&mdash;and then there was some milk and water,<br/>
With a slight shade of blue too, it might be,<br/>
    Beneath the surface; but what did it matter?<br/>
Love &rsquo;s riotous, but marriage should have quiet,<br/>
And being consumptive, live on a milk diet.<br/>
<br/>
And then there was the Miss Audacia Shoestring,<br/>
    A dashing demoiselle of good estate,<br/>
Whose heart was fix&rsquo;d upon a star or blue string;<br/>
    But whether English dukes grew rare of late,<br/>
Or that she had not harp&rsquo;d upon the true string,<br/>
    By which such sirens can attract our great,<br/>
She took up with some foreign younger brother,<br/>
A Russ or Turk&mdash;the one &rsquo;s as good as t&rsquo; other.<br/>
<br/>
And then there was&mdash;but why should I go on,<br/>
    Unless the ladies should go off?&mdash;there was<br/>
Indeed a certain fair and fairy one,<br/>
    Of the best class, and better than her class,&mdash;<br/>
Aurora Raby, a young star who shone<br/>
    O&rsquo;er life, too sweet an image for such glass,<br/>
A lovely being, scarcely form&rsquo;d or moulded,<br/>
A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded;<br/>
<br/>
Rich, noble, but an orphan; left an only<br/>
    Child to the care of guardians good and kind;<br/>
But still her aspect had an air so lonely!<br/>
    Blood is not water; and where shall we find<br/>
Feelings of youth like those which overthrown lie<br/>
    By death, when we are left, alas! behind,<br/>
To feel, in friendless palaces, a home<br/>
Is wanting, and our best ties in the tomb?<br/>
<br/>
Early in years, and yet more infantine<br/>
    In figure, she had something of sublime<br/>
In eyes which sadly shone, as seraphs&rsquo; shine.<br/>
    All youth&mdash;but with an aspect beyond time;<br/>
Radiant and grave&mdash;as pitying man&rsquo;s decline;<br/>
    Mournful&mdash;but mournful of another&rsquo;s crime,<br/>
She look&rsquo;d as if she sat by Eden&rsquo;s door.<br/>
And grieved for those who could return no more.<br/>
<br/>
She was a Catholic, too, sincere, austere,<br/>
    As far as her own gentle heart allow&rsquo;d,<br/>
And deem&rsquo;d that fallen worship far more dear<br/>
    Perhaps because &rsquo;twas fallen: her sires were proud<br/>
Of deeds and days when they had fill&rsquo;d the ear<br/>
    Of nations, and had never bent or bow&rsquo;d<br/>
To novel power; and as she was the last,<br/>
She held their old faith and old feelings fast.<br/>
<br/>
She gazed upon a world she scarcely knew,<br/>
    As seeking not to know it; silent, lone,<br/>
As grows a flower, thus quietly she grew,<br/>
    And kept her heart serene within its zone.<br/>
There was awe in the homage which she drew;<br/>
    Her spirit seem&rsquo;d as seated on a throne<br/>
Apart from the surrounding world, and strong<br/>
In its own strength&mdash;most strange in one so young!<br/>
<br/>
Now it so happen&rsquo;d, in the catalogue<br/>
    Of Adeline, Aurora was omitted,<br/>
Although her birth and wealth had given her vogue<br/>
    Beyond the charmers we have already cited;<br/>
Her beauty also seem&rsquo;d to form no clog<br/>
    Against her being mention&rsquo;d as well fitted,<br/>
By many virtues, to be worth the trouble<br/>
Of single gentlemen who would be double.<br/>
<br/>
And this omission, like that of the bust<br/>
    Of Brutus at the pageant of Tiberius,<br/>
Made Juan wonder, as no doubt he must.<br/>
    This he express&rsquo;d half smiling and half serious;<br/>
When Adeline replied with some disgust,<br/>
    And with an air, to say the least, imperious,<br/>
She marvell&rsquo;d &lsquo;what he saw in such a baby<br/>
As that prim, silent, cold Aurora Raby?&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Juan rejoin&rsquo;d&mdash;&lsquo;She was a Catholic,<br/>
    And therefore fittest, as of his persuasion;<br/>
Since he was sure his mother would fall sick,<br/>
    And the Pope thunder excommunication,<br/>
If-&rsquo; But here Adeline, who seem&rsquo;d to pique<br/>
    Herself extremely on the inoculation<br/>
Of others with her own opinions, stated&mdash;<br/>
As usual&mdash;the same reason which she late did.<br/>
<br/>
And wherefore not? A reasonable reason,<br/>
    If good, is none the worse for repetition;<br/>
If bad, the best way &rsquo;s certainly to tease on,<br/>
    And amplify: you lose much by concision,<br/>
Whereas insisting in or out of season<br/>
    Convinces all men, even a politician;<br/>
Or&mdash;what is just the same&mdash;it wearies out.<br/>
So the end &rsquo;s gain&rsquo;d, what signifies the route?<br/>
<br/>
Why Adeline had this slight prejudice&mdash;<br/>
    For prejudice it was&mdash;against a creature<br/>
As pure as sanctity itself from vice,<br/>
    With all the added charm of form and feature,<br/>
For me appears a question far too nice,<br/>
    Since Adeline was liberal by nature;<br/>
But nature &rsquo;s nature, and has more caprices<br/>
Than I have time, or will, to take to pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps she did not like the quiet way<br/>
    With which Aurora on those baubles look&rsquo;d,<br/>
Which charm most people in their earlier day:<br/>
    For there are few things by mankind less brook&rsquo;d,<br/>
And womankind too, if we so may say,<br/>
    Than finding thus their genius stand rebuked,<br/>
Like &lsquo;Anthony&rsquo;s by Caesar,&rsquo; by the few<br/>
Who look upon them as they ought to do.<br/>
<br/>
It was not envy&mdash;Adeline had none;<br/>
    Her place was far beyond it, and her mind.<br/>
It was not scorn&mdash;which could not light on one<br/>
    Whose greatest fault was leaving few to find.<br/>
It was not jealousy, I think: but shun<br/>
    Following the &lsquo;ignes fatui&rsquo; of mankind.<br/>
It was not&mdash;but &rsquo;tis easier far, alas!<br/>
To say what it was not than what it was.<br/>
<br/>
Little Aurora deem&rsquo;d she was the theme<br/>
    Of such discussion. She was there a guest;<br/>
A beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream<br/>
    Of rank and youth, though purer than the rest,<br/>
Which flow&rsquo;d on for a moment in the beam<br/>
    Time sheds a moment o&rsquo;er each sparkling crest.<br/>
Had she known this, she would have calmly smiled&mdash;<br/>
She had so much, or little, of the child.<br/>
<br/>
The dashing and proud air of Adeline<br/>
    Imposed not upon her: she saw her blaze<br/>
Much as she would have seen a glow-worm shine,<br/>
    Then turn&rsquo;d unto the stars for loftier rays.<br/>
Juan was something she could not divine,<br/>
    Being no sibyl in the new world&rsquo;s ways;<br/>
Yet she was nothing dazzled by the meteor,<br/>
Because she did not pin her faith on feature.<br/>
<br/>
His fame too,&mdash;for he had that kind of fame<br/>
    Which sometimes plays the deuce with womankind,<br/>
A heterogeneous mass of glorious blame,<br/>
    Half virtues and whole vices being combined;<br/>
Faults which attract because they are not tame;<br/>
    Follies trick&rsquo;d out so brightly that they blind:&mdash;<br/>
These seals upon her wax made no impression,<br/>
Such was her coldness or her self-possession.<br/>
<br/>
Juan knew nought of such a character&mdash;<br/>
    High, yet resembling not his lost Haidee;<br/>
Yet each was radiant in her proper sphere:<br/>
    The island girl, bred up by the lone sea,<br/>
More warm, as lovely, and not less sincere,<br/>
    Was Nature&rsquo;s all: Aurora could not be,<br/>
Nor would be thus:&mdash;the difference in them<br/>
Was such as lies between a flower and gem.<br/>
<br/>
Having wound up with this sublime comparison,<br/>
    Methinks we may proceed upon our narrative,<br/>
And, as my friend Scott says, &lsquo;I sound my warison;&rsquo;<br/>
    Scott, the superlative of my comparative&mdash;<br/>
Scott, who can paint your Christian knight or Saracen,<br/>
    Serf, lord, man, with such skill as none would share it, if<br/>
There had not been one Shakspeare and Voltaire,<br/>
Of one or both of whom he seems the heir.<br/>
<br/>
I say, in my slight way I may proceed<br/>
    To play upon the surface of humanity.<br/>
I write the world, nor care if the world read,<br/>
    At least for this I cannot spare its vanity.<br/>
My Muse hath bred, and still perhaps may breed<br/>
    More foes by this same scroll: when I began it, I<br/>
Thought that it might turn out so&mdash;now I know it,<br/>
But still I am, or was, a pretty poet.<br/>
<br/>
The conference or congress (for it ended<br/>
    As congresses of late do) of the Lady<br/>
Adeline and Don Juan rather blended<br/>
    Some acids with the sweets&mdash;for she was heady;<br/>
But, ere the matter could be marr&rsquo;d or mended,<br/>
    The silvery bell rang, not for &lsquo;dinner ready,<br/>
But for that hour, call&rsquo;d half-hour, given to dress,<br/>
Though ladies&rsquo; robes seem scant enough for less.<br/>
<br/>
Great things were now to be achieved at table,<br/>
    With massy plate for armour, knives and forks<br/>
For weapons; but what Muse since Homer &rsquo;s able<br/>
    (His feasts are not the worst part of his works)<br/>
To draw up in array a single day-bill<br/>
    Of modern dinners? where more mystery lurks,<br/>
In soups or sauces, or a sole ragout,<br/>
    Than witches, b&mdash;ches, or physicians, brew.<br/>
<br/>
There was a goodly &lsquo;soupe a la bonne femme,&rsquo;<br/>
    Though God knows whence it came from; there was, too,<br/>
A turbot for relief of those who cram,<br/>
    Relieved with &lsquo;dindon a la Parigeux;&rsquo;<br/>
There also was&mdash;the sinner that I am!<br/>
    How shall I get this gourmand stanza through?-<br/>
&lsquo;Soupe a la Beauveau,&rsquo; whose relief was dory,<br/>
Relieved itself by pork, for greater glory.<br/>
<br/>
But I must crowd all into one grand mess<br/>
    Or mass; for should I stretch into detail,<br/>
My Muse would run much more into excess,<br/>
    Than when some squeamish people deem her frail.<br/>
But though a &lsquo;bonne vivante,&rsquo; I must confess<br/>
    Her stomach &rsquo;s not her peccant part; this tale<br/>
However doth require some slight refection,<br/>
Just to relieve her spirits from dejection.<br/>
<br/>
Fowls &lsquo;a la Conde,&rsquo; slices eke of salmon,<br/>
    With &lsquo;sauces Genevoises,&rsquo; and haunch of venison;<br/>
Wines too, which might again have slain young Ammon&mdash;<br/>
    A man like whom I hope we shan&rsquo;t see many soon;<br/>
They also set a glazed Westphalian ham on,<br/>
    Whereon Apicius would bestow his benison;<br/>
And then there was champagne with foaming whirls,<br/>
As white as Cleopatra&rsquo;s melted pearls.<br/>
<br/>
Then there was God knows what &lsquo;a l&rsquo;Allemande,&rsquo;<br/>
    &lsquo;A l&rsquo;Espagnole,&rsquo; &lsquo;timballe,&rsquo; and &lsquo;salpicon&rsquo;-<br/>
With things I can&rsquo;t withstand or understand,<br/>
    Though swallow&rsquo;d with much zest upon the whole;<br/>
And &lsquo;entremets&rsquo; to piddle with at hand,<br/>
    Gently to lull down the subsiding soul;<br/>
While great Lucullus&rsquo; Robe triumphal muffles<br/>
(There&rsquo;s fame) young partridge fillets, deck&rsquo;d with truffles.<br/>
<br/>
What are the fillets on the victor&rsquo;s brow<br/>
    To these? They are rags or dust. Where is the arch<br/>
Which nodded to the nation&rsquo;s spoils below?<br/>
    Where the triumphal chariots&rsquo; haughty march?<br/>
Gone to where victories must like dinners go.<br/>
    Farther I shall not follow the research:<br/>
But oh! ye modern heroes with your cartridges,<br/>
When will your names lend lustre e&rsquo;en to partridges?<br/>
<br/>
Those truffles too are no bad accessaries,<br/>
    Follow&rsquo;d by &lsquo;petits puits d&rsquo;amour&rsquo;&mdash;a dish<br/>
Of which perhaps the cookery rather varies,<br/>
    So every one may dress it to his wish,<br/>
According to the best of dictionaries,<br/>
    Which encyclopedize both flesh and fish;<br/>
But even sans &lsquo;confitures,&rsquo; it no less true is,<br/>
There&rsquo;s pretty picking in those &lsquo;petits puits.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
The mind is lost in mighty contemplation<br/>
    Of intellect expanded on two courses;<br/>
And indigestion&rsquo;s grand multiplication<br/>
    Requires arithmetic beyond my forces.<br/>
Who would suppose, from Adam&rsquo;s simple ration,<br/>
    That cookery could have call&rsquo;d forth such resources,<br/>
As form a science and a nomenclature<br/>
From out the commonest demands of nature?<br/>
<br/>
The glasses jingled, and the palates tingled;<br/>
    The diners of celebrity dined well;<br/>
The ladies with more moderation mingled<br/>
    In the feast, pecking less than I can tell;<br/>
Also the younger men too: for a springald<br/>
    Can&rsquo;t, like ripe age, in gormandize excel,<br/>
But thinks less of good eating than the whisper<br/>
(When seated next him) of some pretty lisper.<br/>
<br/>
Alas! I must leave undescribed the gibier,<br/>
    The salmi, the consomme, the puree,<br/>
All which I use to make my rhymes run glibber<br/>
    Than could roast beef in our rough John Bull way:<br/>
I must not introduce even a spare rib here,<br/>
    &lsquo;Bubble and squeak&rsquo; would spoil my liquid lay:<br/>
But I have dined, and must forego, Alas!<br/>
The chaste description even of a &lsquo;becasse;&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
And fruits, and ice, and all that art refines<br/>
    From nature for the service of the gout&mdash;<br/>
Taste or the gout,&mdash;pronounce it as inclines<br/>
    Your stomach! Ere you dine, the French will do;<br/>
But after, there are sometimes certain signs<br/>
    Which prove plain English truer of the two.<br/>
Hast ever had the gout? I have not had it&mdash;<br/>
But I may have, and you too, reader, dread it.<br/>
<br/>
The simple olives, best allies of wine,<br/>
    Must I pass over in my bill of fare?<br/>
I must, although a favourite &lsquo;plat&rsquo; of mine<br/>
    In Spain, and Lucca, Athens, every where:<br/>
On them and bread &rsquo;twas oft my luck to dine,<br/>
    The grass my table-cloth, in open-air,<br/>
On Sunium or Hymettus, like Diogenes,<br/>
Of whom half my philosophy the progeny is.<br/>
<br/>
Amidst this tumult of fish, flesh, and &lsquo;fowl,<br/>
    And vegetables, all in masquerade,<br/>
The guests were placed according to their roll,<br/>
    But various as the various meats display&rsquo;d:<br/>
Don Juan sat next &lsquo;an l&rsquo;Espagnole&rsquo;-<br/>
    No damsel, but a dish, as hath been said;<br/>
But so far like a lady, that &rsquo;twas drest<br/>
Superbly, and contain&rsquo;d a world of zest.<br/>
<br/>
By some odd chance too, he was placed between<br/>
    Aurora and the Lady Adeline&mdash;<br/>
A situation difficult, I ween,<br/>
    For man therein, with eyes and heart, to dine.<br/>
Also the conference which we have seen<br/>
    Was not such as to encourage him to shine;<br/>
For Adeline, addressing few words to him,<br/>
With two transcendent eyes seem&rsquo;d to look through him.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes almost think that eyes have ears:<br/>
    This much is sure, that, out of earshot, things<br/>
Are somehow echoed to the pretty dears,<br/>
    Of which I can&rsquo;t tell whence their knowledge springs.<br/>
Like that same mystic music of the spheres,<br/>
    Which no one bears, so loudly though it rings,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis wonderful how oft the sex have heard<br/>
Long dialogues&mdash;which pass&rsquo;d without a word!<br/>
<br/>
Aurora sat with that indifference<br/>
    Which piques a preux chevalier&mdash;as it ought:<br/>
Of all offences that &rsquo;s the worst offence,<br/>
    Which seems to hint you are not worth a thought.<br/>
Now Juan, though no coxcomb in pretence,<br/>
    Was not exactly pleased to be so caught;<br/>
Like a good ship entangled among ice,<br/>
And after so much excellent advice.<br/>
<br/>
To his gay nothings, nothing was replied,<br/>
    Or something which was nothing, as urbanity<br/>
Required. Aurora scarcely look&rsquo;d aside,<br/>
    Nor even smiled enough for any vanity.<br/>
The devil was in the girl! Could it be pride?<br/>
    Or modesty, or absence, or inanity?<br/>
Heaven knows? But Adeline&rsquo;s malicious eyes<br/>
Sparkled with her successful prophecies,<br/>
<br/>
And look&rsquo;d as much as if to say, &lsquo;I said it;&rsquo;<br/>
    A kind of triumph I&rsquo;ll not recommend,<br/>
Because it sometimes, as I have seen or read it,<br/>
    Both in the case of lover and of friend,<br/>
Will pique a gentleman, for his own credit,<br/>
    To bring what was a jest to a serious end:<br/>
For all men prophesy what is or was,<br/>
And hate those who won&rsquo;t let them come to pass.<br/>
<br/>
Juan was drawn thus into some attentions,<br/>
    Slight but select, and just enough to express,<br/>
To females of perspicuous comprehensions,<br/>
    That he would rather make them more than less.<br/>
Aurora at the last (so history mentions,<br/>
    Though probably much less a fact than guess)<br/>
So far relax&rsquo;d her thoughts from their sweet prison,<br/>
As once or twice to smile, if not to listen.<br/>
<br/>
From answering she began to question; this<br/>
    With her was rare: and Adeline, who as yet<br/>
Thought her predictions went not much amiss,<br/>
    Began to dread she&rsquo;d thaw to a coquette&mdash;<br/>
So very difficult, they say, it is<br/>
    To keep extremes from meeting, when once set<br/>
In motion; but she here too much refined&mdash;<br/>
Aurora&rsquo;s spirit was not of that kind.<br/>
<br/>
But Juan had a sort of winning way,<br/>
    A proud humility, if such there be,<br/>
Which show&rsquo;d such deference to what females say,<br/>
    As if each charming word were a decree.<br/>
His tact, too, temper&rsquo;d him from grave to gay,<br/>
    And taught him when to be reserved or free:<br/>
He had the art of drawing people out,<br/>
Without their seeing what he was about.<br/>
<br/>
Aurora, who in her indifference<br/>
    Confounded him in common with the crowd<br/>
Of flatterers, though she deem&rsquo;d he had more sense<br/>
    Than whispering foplings, or than witlings loud&mdash;<br/>
Commenced (from such slight things will great commence)<br/>
    To feel that flattery which attracts the proud<br/>
Rather by deference than compliment,<br/>
And wins even by a delicate dissent.<br/>
<br/>
And then he had good looks;&mdash;that point was carried<br/>
    Nem. con. amongst the women, which I grieve<br/>
To say leads oft to crim. con. with the married&mdash;<br/>
    A case which to the juries we may leave,<br/>
Since with digressions we too long have tarried.<br/>
    Now though we know of old that looks deceive,<br/>
And always have done, somehow these good looks<br/>
Make more impression than the best of books.<br/>
<br/>
Aurora, who look&rsquo;d more on books than faces,<br/>
    Was very young, although so very sage,<br/>
Admiring more Minerva than the Graces,<br/>
    Especially upon a printed page.<br/>
But Virtue&rsquo;s self, with all her tightest laces,<br/>
    Has not the natural stays of strict old age;<br/>
And Socrates, that model of all duty,<br/>
Own&rsquo;d to a penchant, though discreet, for beauty.<br/>
<br/>
And girls of sixteen are thus far Socratic,<br/>
    But innocently so, as Socrates;<br/>
And really, if the sage sublime and Attic<br/>
    At seventy years had phantasies like these,<br/>
Which Plato in his dialogues dramatic<br/>
    Has shown, I know not why they should displease<br/>
In virgins&mdash;always in a modest way,<br/>
Observe; for that with me &rsquo;s a &lsquo;sine qua.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
Also observe, that, like the great Lord Coke<br/>
    (See Littleton), whene&rsquo;er I have express&rsquo;d<br/>
Opinions two, which at first sight may look<br/>
    Twin opposites, the second is the best.<br/>
Perhaps I have a third, too, in a nook,<br/>
    Or none at all&mdash;which seems a sorry jest:<br/>
But if a writer should be quite consistent,<br/>
How could he possibly show things existent?<br/>
<br/>
If people contradict themselves, can I<br/>
    Help contradicting them, and every body,<br/>
Even my veracious self?&mdash;But that &rsquo;s a lie:<br/>
    I never did so, never will&mdash;how should I?<br/>
He who doubts all things nothing can deny:<br/>
    Truth&rsquo;s fountains may be clear&mdash;her streams are muddy,<br/>
And cut through such canals of contradiction,<br/>
That she must often navigate o&rsquo;er fiction.<br/>
<br/>
Apologue, fable, poesy, and parable,<br/>
    Are false, but may he render&rsquo;d also true,<br/>
By those who sow them in a land that &rsquo;s arable.<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis wonderful what fable will not do!<br/>
&rsquo;Tis said it makes reality more bearable:<br/>
    But what &rsquo;s reality? Who has its clue?<br/>
Philosophy? No: she too much rejects.<br/>
Religion? Yes; but which of all her sects?<br/>
<br/>
Some millions must be wrong, that &rsquo;s pretty dear;<br/>
    Perhaps it may turn out that all were right.<br/>
God help us! Since we have need on our career<br/>
    To keep our holy beacons always bright,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis time that some new prophet should appear,<br/>
    Or old indulge man with a second sight.<br/>
Opinions wear out in some thousand years,<br/>
Without a small refreshment from the spheres.<br/>
<br/>
But here again, why will I thus entangle<br/>
    Myself with metaphysics? None can hate<br/>
So much as I do any kind of wrangle;<br/>
    And yet, such is my folly, or my fate,<br/>
I always knock my head against some angle<br/>
    About the present, past, or future state.<br/>
Yet I wish well to Trojan and to Tyrian,<br/>
For I was bred a moderate Presbyterian.<br/>
<br/>
But though I am a temperate theologian,<br/>
    And also meek as a metaphysician,<br/>
Impartial between Tyrian and Trojan,<br/>
    As Eldon on a lunatic commission&mdash;<br/>
In politics my duty is to show John<br/>
    Bull something of the lower world&rsquo;s condition.<br/>
It makes my blood boil like the springs of Hecla,<br/>
To see men let these scoundrel sovereigns break law.<br/>
<br/>
But politics, and policy, and piety,<br/>
    Are topics which I sometimes introduce,<br/>
Not only for the sake of their variety,<br/>
    But as subservient to a moral use;<br/>
Because my business is to dress society,<br/>
    And stuff with sage that very verdant goose.<br/>
And now, that we may furnish with some matter all<br/>
Tastes, we are going to try the supernatural.<br/>
<br/>
And now I will give up all argument;<br/>
    And positively henceforth no temptation<br/>
Shall &lsquo;fool me to the top up of my bent:&rsquo;-<br/>
    Yes, I&rsquo; ll begin a thorough reformation.<br/>
Indeed, I never knew what people meant<br/>
    By deeming that my Muse&rsquo;s conversation<br/>
Was dangerous;&mdash;I think she is as harmless<br/>
As some who labour more and yet may charm less.<br/>
<br/>
Grim reader! did you ever see a ghost?<br/>
    No; but you have heard&mdash;I understand&mdash;be dumb!<br/>
And don&rsquo;t regret the time you may have lost,<br/>
    For you have got that pleasure still to come:<br/>
And do not think I mean to sneer at most<br/>
    Of these things, or by ridicule benumb<br/>
That source of the sublime and the mysterious:&mdash;<br/>
For certain reasons my belief is serious.<br/>
<br/>
Serious? You laugh;&mdash;you may: that will I not;<br/>
    My smiles must be sincere or not at all.<br/>
I say I do believe a haunted spot<br/>
    Exists&mdash;and where? That shall I not recall,<br/>
Because I&rsquo;d rather it should be forgot,<br/>
    &lsquo;Shadows the soul of Richard&rsquo; may appal.<br/>
In short, upon that subject I&rsquo;ve some qualms very<br/>
Like those of the philosopher of Malmsbury.<br/>
<br/>
The night (I sing by night&mdash;sometimes an owl,<br/>
    And now and then a nightingale) is dim,<br/>
And the loud shriek of sage Minerva&rsquo;s fowl<br/>
    Rattles around me her discordant hymn:<br/>
Old portraits from old walls upon me scowl&mdash;<br/>
    I wish to heaven they would not look so grim;<br/>
The dying embers dwindle in the grate&mdash;<br/>
I think too that I have sate up too late:<br/>
<br/>
And therefore, though &rsquo;tis by no means my way<br/>
    To rhyme at noon&mdash;when I have other things<br/>
To think of, if I ever think&mdash;I say<br/>
    I feel some chilly midnight shudderings,<br/>
And prudently postpone, until mid-day,<br/>
    Treating a topic which, alas! but brings<br/>
Shadows;&mdash;but you must be in my condition<br/>
Before you learn to call this superstition.<br/>

<h2><a name="2H_4_0017"></a>
CANTO THE SIXTEENTH.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
The antique Persians taught three useful things,<br/>
    To draw the bow, to ride, and speak the truth.<br/>
This was the mode of Cyrus, best of kings&mdash;<br/>
    A mode adopted since by modern youth.<br/>
Bows have they, generally with two strings;<br/>
    Horses they ride without remorse or ruth;<br/>
At speaking truth perhaps they are less clever,<br/>
But draw the long bow better now than ever.<br/>
<br/>
The cause of this effect, or this defect,&mdash;<br/>
    &lsquo;For this effect defective comes by cause,&rsquo;-<br/>
Is what I have not leisure to inspect;<br/>
    But this I must say in my own applause,<br/>
Of all the Muses that I recollect,<br/>
    Whate&rsquo;er may be her follies or her flaws<br/>
In some things, mine &rsquo;s beyond all contradiction<br/>
The most sincere that ever dealt in fiction.<br/>
<br/>
And as she treats all things, and ne&rsquo;er retreats<br/>
    From any thing, this epic will contain<br/>
A wilderness of the most rare conceits,<br/>
    Which you might elsewhere hope to find in vain.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis true there be some bitters with the sweets,<br/>
    Yet mix&rsquo;d so slightly, that you can&rsquo;t complain,<br/>
But wonder they so few are, since my tale is<br/>
&lsquo;De rebus cunctis et quibusdam aliis.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
But of all truths which she has told, the most<br/>
    True is that which she is about to tell.<br/>
I said it was a story of a ghost&mdash;<br/>
    What then? I only know it so befell.<br/>
Have you explored the limits of the coast,<br/>
    Where all the dwellers of the earth must dwell?<br/>
&rsquo;Tis time to strike such puny doubters dumb as<br/>
The sceptics who would not believe Columbus.<br/>
<br/>
Some people would impose now with authority,<br/>
    Turpin&rsquo;s or Monmouth Geoffry&rsquo;s Chronicle;<br/>
Men whose historical superiority<br/>
    Is always greatest at a miracle.<br/>
But Saint Augustine has the great priority,<br/>
    Who bids all men believe the impossible,<br/>
Because &rsquo;tis so. Who nibble, scribble, quibble, he<br/>
Quiets at once with &lsquo;quia impossibile.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
And therefore, mortals, cavil not at all;<br/>
    Believe:&mdash;if &rsquo;tis improbable you must,<br/>
And if it is impossible, you shall:<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis always best to take things upon trust.<br/>
I do not speak profanely, to recall<br/>
    Those holier mysteries which the wise and just<br/>
Receive as gospel, and which grow more rooted,<br/>
As all truths must, the more they are disputed:<br/>
<br/>
I merely mean to say what Johnson said,<br/>
    That in the course of some six thousand years,<br/>
All nations have believed that from the dead<br/>
    A visitant at intervals appears;<br/>
And what is strangest upon this strange head,<br/>
    Is, that whatever bar the reason rears<br/>
&rsquo;Gainst such belief, there&rsquo;s something stronger still<br/>
In its behalf, let those deny who will.<br/>
<br/>
The dinner and the soiree too were done,<br/>
    The supper too discuss&rsquo;d, the dames admired,<br/>
The banqueteers had dropp&rsquo;d off one by one&mdash;<br/>
    The song was silent, and the dance expired:<br/>
The last thin petticoats were vanish&rsquo;d, gone<br/>
    Like fleecy Clouds into the sky retired,<br/>
And nothing brighter gleam&rsquo;d through the saloon<br/>
Than dying tapers&mdash;and the peeping moon.<br/>
<br/>
The evaporation of a joyous day<br/>
    Is like the last glass of champagne, without<br/>
The foam which made its virgin bumper gay;<br/>
    Or like a system coupled with a doubt;<br/>
Or like a soda bottle when its spray<br/>
    Has sparkled and let half its spirit out;<br/>
Or like a billow left by storms behind,<br/>
Without the animation of the wind;<br/>
<br/>
Or like an opiate, which brings troubled rest,<br/>
    Or none; or like&mdash;like nothing that I know<br/>
Except itself;&mdash;such is the human breast;<br/>
    A thing, of which similitudes can show<br/>
No real likeness,&mdash;like the old Tyrian vest<br/>
    Dyed purple, none at present can tell how,<br/>
If from a shell-fish or from cochineal.<br/>
So perish every tyrant&rsquo;s robe piece-meal!<br/>
<br/>
But next to dressing for a rout or ball,<br/>
    Undressing is a woe; our robe de chambre<br/>
May sit like that of Nessus, and recall<br/>
    Thoughts quite as yellow, but less clear than amber.<br/>
Titus exclaim&rsquo;d, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve lost a day!&rsquo; Of all<br/>
    The nights and days most people can remember<br/>
(I have had of both, some not to be disdain&rsquo;d),<br/>
I wish they&rsquo;d state how many they have gain&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
And Juan, on retiring for the night,<br/>
    Felt restless, and perplex&rsquo;d, and compromised:<br/>
He thought Aurora Raby&rsquo;s eyes more bright<br/>
    Than Adeline (such is advice) advised;<br/>
If he had known exactly his own plight,<br/>
    He probably would have philosophised:<br/>
A great resource to all, and ne&rsquo;er denied<br/>
Till wanted; therefore Juan only sigh&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
He sigh&rsquo;d;&mdash;the next resource is the full moon,<br/>
    Where all sighs are deposited; and now<br/>
It happen&rsquo;d luckily, the chaste orb shone<br/>
    As clear as such a climate will allow;<br/>
And Juan&rsquo;s mind was in the proper tone<br/>
    To hail her with the apostrophe&mdash;&lsquo;O thou!&rsquo;<br/>
Of amatory egotism the Tuism,<br/>
Which further to explain would be a truism.<br/>
<br/>
But lover, poet, or astronomer,<br/>
    Shepherd, or swain, whoever may behold,<br/>
Feel some abstraction when they gaze on her:<br/>
    Great thoughts we catch from thence (besides a cold<br/>
Sometimes, unless my feelings rather err);<br/>
    Deep secrets to her rolling light are told;<br/>
The ocean&rsquo;s tides and mortals&rsquo; brains she sways,<br/>
And also hearts, if there be truth in lays.<br/>
<br/>
Juan felt somewhat pensive, and disposed<br/>
    For contemplation rather than his pillow:<br/>
The Gothic chamber, where he was enclosed,<br/>
    Let in the rippling sound of the lake&rsquo;s billow,<br/>
With all the mystery by midnight caused;<br/>
    Below his window waved (of course) a willow;<br/>
And he stood gazing out on the cascade<br/>
That flash&rsquo;d and after darken&rsquo;d in the shade.<br/>
<br/>
Upon his table or his toilet,&mdash;which<br/>
    Of these is not exactly ascertain&rsquo;d<br/>
(I state this, for I am cautious to a pitch<br/>
    Of nicety, where a fact is to be gain&rsquo;d),&mdash;<br/>
A lamp burn&rsquo;d high, while he leant from a niche,<br/>
    Where many a Gothic ornament remain&rsquo;d,<br/>
In chisell&rsquo;d stone and painted glass, and all<br/>
That time has left our fathers of their hall.<br/>
<br/>
Then, as the night was clear though cold, he threw<br/>
    His chamber door wide open&mdash;and went forth<br/>
Into a gallery, of a sombre hue,<br/>
    Long, furnish&rsquo;d with old pictures of great worth,<br/>
Of knights and dames heroic and chaste too,<br/>
    As doubtless should be people of high birth.<br/>
But by dim lights the portraits of the dead<br/>
Have something ghastly, desolate, and dread.<br/>
<br/>
The forms of the grim knight and pictured saint<br/>
    Look living in the moon; and as you turn<br/>
Backward and forward to the echoes faint<br/>
    Of your own footsteps&mdash;voices from the urn<br/>
Appear to wake, and shadows wild and quaint<br/>
    Start from the frames which fence their aspects stern,<br/>
As if to ask how you can dare to keep<br/>
A vigil there, where all but death should sleep.<br/>
<br/>
And the pale smile of beauties in the grave,<br/>
    The charms of other days, in starlight gleams,<br/>
Glimmer on high; their buried locks still wave<br/>
    Along the canvas; their eyes glance like dreams<br/>
On ours, or spars within some dusky cave,<br/>
    But death is imaged in their shadowy beams.<br/>
A picture is the past; even ere its frame<br/>
Be gilt, who sate hath ceased to be the same.<br/>
<br/>
As Juan mused on mutability,<br/>
    Or on his mistress&mdash;terms synonymous&mdash;<br/>
No sound except the echo of his sigh<br/>
    Or step ran sadly through that antique house;<br/>
When suddenly he heard, or thought so, nigh,<br/>
    A supernatural agent&mdash;or a mouse,<br/>
Whose little nibbling rustle will embarrass<br/>
Most people as it plays along the arras.<br/>
<br/>
It was no mouse, but lo! a monk, array&rsquo;d<br/>
    In cowl and beads and dusky garb, appear&rsquo;d,<br/>
Now in the moonlight, and now lapsed in shade,<br/>
    With steps that trod as heavy, yet unheard;<br/>
His garments only a slight murmur made;<br/>
    He moved as shadowy as the sisters weird,<br/>
But slowly; and as he pass&rsquo;d Juan by,<br/>
Glanced, without pausing, on him a bright eye.<br/>
<br/>
Juan was petrified; he had heard a hint<br/>
    Of such a spirit in these halls of old,<br/>
But thought, like most men, there was nothing in &rsquo;t<br/>
    Beyond the rumour which such spots unfold,<br/>
Coin&rsquo;d from surviving superstition&rsquo;s mint,<br/>
    Which passes ghosts in currency like gold,<br/>
But rarely seen, like gold compared with paper.<br/>
And did he see this? or was it a vapour?<br/>
<br/>
Once, twice, thrice pass&rsquo;d, repass&rsquo;d&mdash;the thing of air,<br/>
    Or earth beneath, or heaven, or t&rsquo; other place;<br/>
And Juan gazed upon it with a stare,<br/>
    Yet could not speak or move; but, on its base<br/>
As stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair<br/>
    Twine like a knot of snakes around his face;<br/>
He tax&rsquo;d his tongue for words, which were not granted,<br/>
To ask the reverend person what he wanted.<br/>
<br/>
The third time, after a still longer pause,<br/>
    The shadow pass&rsquo;d away&mdash;but where? the hall<br/>
Was long, and thus far there was no great cause<br/>
    To think his vanishing unnatural:<br/>
Doors there were many, through which, by the laws<br/>
    Of physics, bodies whether short or tall<br/>
Might come or go; but Juan could not state<br/>
Through which the spectre seem&rsquo;d to evaporate.<br/>
<br/>
He stood&mdash;how long he knew not, but it seem&rsquo;d<br/>
    An age&mdash;expectant, powerless, with his eyes<br/>
Strain&rsquo;d on the spot where first the figure gleam&rsquo;d;<br/>
    Then by degrees recall&rsquo;d his energies,<br/>
And would have pass&rsquo;d the whole off as a dream,<br/>
    But could not wake; he was, he did surmise,<br/>
Waking already, and return&rsquo;d at length<br/>
Back to his chamber, shorn of half his strength.<br/>
<br/>
All there was as he left it: still his taper<br/>
    Burnt, and not blue, as modest tapers use,<br/>
Receiving sprites with sympathetic vapour;<br/>
    He rubb&rsquo;d his eyes, and they did not refuse<br/>
Their office; he took up an old newspaper;<br/>
    The paper was right easy to peruse;<br/>
He read an article the king attacking,<br/>
And a long eulogy of &lsquo;patent blacking.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
This savour&rsquo;d of this world; but his hand shook&mdash;<br/>
    He shut his door, and after having read<br/>
A paragraph, I think about Horne Tooke,<br/>
    Undrest, and rather slowly went to bed.<br/>
There, couch&rsquo;d all snugly on his pillow&rsquo;s nook,<br/>
    With what he had seen his phantasy he fed;<br/>
And though it was no opiate, slumber crept<br/>
Upon him by degrees, and so he slept.<br/>
<br/>
He woke betimes; and, as may be supposed,<br/>
    Ponder&rsquo;d upon his visitant or vision,<br/>
And whether it ought not to be disclosed,<br/>
    At risk of being quizz&rsquo;d for superstition.<br/>
The more he thought, the more his mind was posed:<br/>
    In the mean time, his valet, whose precision<br/>
Was great, because his master brook&rsquo;d no less,<br/>
Knock&rsquo;d to inform him it was time to dress.<br/>
<br/>
He dress&rsquo;d; and like young people he was wont<br/>
    To take some trouble with his toilet, but<br/>
This morning rather spent less time upon &rsquo;t;<br/>
    Aside his very mirror soon was put;<br/>
His curls fell negligently o&rsquo;er his front,<br/>
    His clothes were not curb&rsquo;d to their usual cut,<br/>
His very neckcloth&rsquo;s Gordian knot was tied<br/>
Almost an hair&rsquo;s breadth too much on one side.<br/>
<br/>
And when he walk&rsquo;d down into the saloon,<br/>
    He sate him pensive o&rsquo;er a dish of tea,<br/>
Which he perhaps had not discover&rsquo;d soon,<br/>
    Had it not happen&rsquo;d scalding hot to be,<br/>
Which made him have recourse unto his spoon;<br/>
    So much distrait he was, that all could see<br/>
That something was the matter&mdash;Adeline<br/>
The first&mdash;but what she could not well divine.<br/>
<br/>
She look&rsquo;d, and saw him pale, and turn&rsquo;d as pale<br/>
    Herself; then hastily look&rsquo;d down, and mutter&rsquo;d<br/>
Something, but what &rsquo;s not stated in my tale.<br/>
    Lord Henry said his muffin was ill butter&rsquo;d;<br/>
The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke play&rsquo;d with her veil,<br/>
    And look&rsquo;d at Juan hard, but nothing utter&rsquo;d.<br/>
Aurora Raby with her large dark eyes<br/>
Survey&rsquo;d him with a kind of calm surprise.<br/>
<br/>
But seeing him all cold and silent still,<br/>
    And everybody wondering more or less,<br/>
Fair Adeline enquired, &lsquo;If he were ill?&rsquo;<br/>
    He started, and said, &lsquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;rather&mdash;yes.&rsquo;<br/>
The family physician had great skill,<br/>
    And being present, now began to express<br/>
His readiness to feel his pulse and tell<br/>
The cause, but Juan said, &lsquo;He was quite well.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Quite well; yes,&mdash;no.&rsquo;&mdash;These answers were mysterious,<br/>
    And yet his looks appear&rsquo;d to sanction both,<br/>
However they might savour of delirious;<br/>
    Something like illness of a sudden growth<br/>
Weigh&rsquo;d on his spirit, though by no means serious:<br/>
    But for the rest, as he himself seem&rsquo;d loth<br/>
To state the case, it might be ta&rsquo;en for granted<br/>
It was not the physician that he wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Henry, who had now discuss&rsquo;d his chocolate,<br/>
    Also the muffin whereof he complain&rsquo;d,<br/>
Said, Juan had not got his usual look elate,<br/>
    At which he marvell&rsquo;d, since it had not rain&rsquo;d;<br/>
Then ask&rsquo;d her Grace what news were of the duke of late?<br/>
    Her Grace replied, his Grace was rather pain&rsquo;d<br/>
With some slight, light, hereditary twinges<br/>
Of gout, which rusts aristocratic hinges.<br/>
<br/>
Then Henry turn&rsquo;d to Juan, and address&rsquo;d<br/>
    A few words of condolence on his state:<br/>
&lsquo;You look,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;as if you had had your rest<br/>
    Broke in upon by the Black Friar of late.&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;What friar?&rsquo; said Juan; and he did his best<br/>
    To put the question with an air sedate,<br/>
Or careless; but the effort was not valid<br/>
To hinder him from growing still more pallid.<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Oh! have you never heard of the Black Friar?<br/>
    The spirit of these walls?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;In truth not I.&rsquo;<br/>
&lsquo;Why Fame&mdash;but Fame you know &rsquo;s sometimes a liar&mdash;<br/>
    Tells an odd story, of which by and by:<br/>
Whether with time the spectre has grown shyer,<br/>
    Or that our sires had a more gifted eye<br/>
For such sights, though the tale is half believed,<br/>
The friar of late has not been oft perceived.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;The last time was&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;I pray,&rdquo; said Adeline&mdash;<br/>
    (Who watch&rsquo;d the changes of Don Juan&rsquo;s brow,<br/>
And from its context thought she could divine<br/>
    Connexions stronger then he chose to avow<br/>
With this same legend)&mdash;&lsquo;if you but design<br/>
    To jest, you&rsquo;ll choose some other theme just now,<br/>
Because the present tale has oft been told,<br/>
And is not much improved by growing old.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;Jest!&rsquo; quoth Milor; &lsquo;why, Adeline, you know<br/>
    That we ourselves&mdash;&rsquo;twas in the honey-moon&mdash;<br/>
Saw&mdash;&ldquo; &rdquo;Well, no matter, &rsquo;twas so long ago;<br/>
    But, come, I&rsquo;ll set your story to a tune.&rsquo;<br/>
Graceful as Dian, when she draws her bow,<br/>
    She seized her harp, whose strings were kindled soon<br/>
As touch&rsquo;d, and plaintively began to play<br/>
The air of &lsquo;&rsquo;Twas a Friar of Orders Gray.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo;But add the words,&rsquo; cried Henry, &lsquo;which you made;<br/>
    For Adeline is half a poetess,&rsquo;<br/>
Turning round to the rest, he smiling said.<br/>
    Of course the others could not but express<br/>
In courtesy their wish to see display&rsquo;d<br/>
    By one three talents, for there were no less&mdash;<br/>
The voice, the words, the harper&rsquo;s skill, at once<br/>
Could hardly be united by a dunce.<br/>
<br/>
After some fascinating hesitation,&mdash;<br/>
    The charming of these charmers, who seem bound,<br/>
I can&rsquo;t tell why, to this dissimulation,&mdash;<br/>
    Fair Adeline, with eyes fix&rsquo;d on the ground<br/>
At first, then kindling into animation,<br/>
    Added her sweet voice to the lyric sound,<br/>
And sang with much simplicity,&mdash;a merit<br/>
Not the less precious, that we seldom hear it.<br/>
<br/>
Beware! beware! of the Black Friar,<br/>
    Who sitteth by Norman stone,<br/>
For he mutters his prayer in the midnight air,<br/>
    And his mass of the days that are gone.<br/>
When the Lord of the Hill, Amundeville,<br/>
    Made Norman Church his prey,<br/>
And expell&rsquo;d the friars, one friar still<br/>
    Would not be driven away.<br/>
<br/>
Though he came in his might, with King Henry&rsquo;s right,<br/>
    To turn church lands to lay,<br/>
With sword in hand, and torch to light<br/>
    Their walls, if they said nay;<br/>
A monk remain&rsquo;d, unchased, unchain&rsquo;d,<br/>
    And he did not seem form&rsquo;d of clay,<br/>
For he &rsquo;s seen in the porch, and he &rsquo;s seen in the church,<br/>
    Though he is not seen by day.<br/>
<br/>
And whether for good, or whether for ill,<br/>
    It is not mine to say;<br/>
But still with the house of Amundeville<br/>
    He abideth night and day.<br/>
By the marriage-bed of their lords, &rsquo;tis said,<br/>
    He flits on the bridal eve;<br/>
And &rsquo;tis held as faith, to their bed of death<br/>
    He comes&mdash;but not to grieve.<br/>
<br/>
When an heir is born, he &rsquo;s heard to mourn,<br/>
    And when aught is to befall<br/>
That ancient line, in the we moonshine<br/>
    He walks from hall to hall.<br/>
His form you may trace, but not his face,<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis shadow&rsquo;d by his cowl;<br/>
But his eyes may be seen from the folds between,<br/>
    And they seem of a parted soul.<br/>
<br/>
But beware! beware! of the Black Friar,<br/>
    He still retains his sway,<br/>
For he is yet the church&rsquo;s heir<br/>
    Whoever may be the lay.<br/>
Amundeville is lord by day,<br/>
    But the monk is lord by night;<br/>
Nor wine nor wassail could raise a vassal<br/>
    To question that friar&rsquo;s right.<br/>
<br/>
Say nought to him as he walks the hall,<br/>
    And he&rsquo;ll say nought to you;<br/>
He sweeps along in his dusky pall,<br/>
    As o&rsquo;er the grass the dew.<br/>
Then grammercy! for the Black Friar;<br/>
    Heaven sain him, fair or foul!<br/>
And whatsoe&rsquo;er may be his prayer,<br/>
    Let ours be for his soul.<br/>
<br/>
The lady&rsquo;s voice ceased, and the thrilling wires<br/>
    Died from the touch that kindled them to sound;<br/>
And the pause follow&rsquo;d, which when song expires<br/>
    Pervades a moment those who listen round;<br/>
And then of course the circle much admires,<br/>
    Nor less applauds, as in politeness bound,<br/>
The tones, the feeling, and the execution,<br/>
To the performer&rsquo;s diffident confusion.<br/>
<br/>
Fair Adeline, though in a careless way,<br/>
    As if she rated such accomplishment<br/>
As the mere pastime of an idle day,<br/>
    Pursued an instant for her own content,<br/>
Would now and then as &rsquo;twere without display,<br/>
    Yet with display in fact, at times relent<br/>
To such performances with haughty smile,<br/>
To show she could, if it were worth her while.<br/>
<br/>
Now this (but we will whisper it aside)<br/>
    Was&mdash;pardon the pedantic illustration&mdash;<br/>
Trampling on Plato&rsquo;s pride with greater pride,<br/>
    As did the Cynic on some like occasion;<br/>
Deeming the sage would be much mortified,<br/>
    Or thrown into a philosophic passion,<br/>
For a spoil&rsquo;d carpet&mdash;but the &lsquo;Attic Bee&rsquo;<br/>
Was much consoled by his own repartee.<br/>
<br/>
Thus Adeline would throw into the shade<br/>
    (By doing easily, whene&rsquo;er she chose,<br/>
What dilettanti do with vast parade)<br/>
    Their sort of half profession; for it grows<br/>
To something like this when too oft display&rsquo;d;<br/>
    And that it is so everybody knows<br/>
Who have heard Miss That or This, or Lady T&rsquo;other,<br/>
Show off&mdash;to please their company or mother.<br/>
<br/>
O! the long evenings of duets and trios!<br/>
    The admirations and the speculations;<br/>
The &lsquo;Mamma Mia&rsquo;s!&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Amor Mio&rsquo;s!&rsquo;<br/>
    The &lsquo;Tanti palpiti&rsquo;s&rsquo; on such occasions:<br/>
The &lsquo;Lasciami&rsquo;s,&rsquo; and quavering &lsquo;Addio&rsquo;s!&rsquo;<br/>
    Amongst our own most musical of nations;<br/>
With &lsquo;Tu mi chamas&rsquo;s&rsquo; from Portingale,<br/>
To soothe our ears, lest Italy should fail.<br/>
<br/>
In Babylon&rsquo;s bravuras&mdash;as the home<br/>
    Heart-ballads of Green Erin or Gray Highlands,<br/>
That bring Lochaber back to eyes that roam<br/>
    O&rsquo;er far Atlantic continents or islands,<br/>
The calentures of music which o&rsquo;ercome<br/>
    All mountaineers with dreams that they are nigh lands,<br/>
No more to be beheld but in such visions&mdash;<br/>
Was Adeline well versed, as compositions.<br/>
<br/>
She also had a twilight tinge of &lsquo;Blue,&rsquo;<br/>
    Could write rhymes, and compose more than she wrote,<br/>
Made epigrams occasionally too<br/>
    Upon her friends, as everybody ought.<br/>
But still from that sublimer azure hue,<br/>
    So much the present dye, she was remote;<br/>
Was weak enough to deem Pope a great poet,<br/>
And what was worse, was not ashamed to show it.<br/>
<br/>
Aurora&mdash;since we are touching upon taste,<br/>
    Which now-a-days is the thermometer<br/>
By whose degrees all characters are class&rsquo;d&mdash;<br/>
    Was more Shakspearian, if I do not err.<br/>
The worlds beyond this world&rsquo;s perplexing waste<br/>
    Had more of her existence, for in her<br/>
There was a depth of feeling to embrace<br/>
Thoughts, boundless, deep, but silent too as Space.<br/>
<br/>
Not so her gracious, graceful, graceless Grace,<br/>
    The full-grown Hebe of Fitz-Fulke, whose mind,<br/>
If she had any, was upon her face,<br/>
    And that was of a fascinating kind.<br/>
A little turn for mischief you might trace<br/>
    Also thereon,&mdash;but that &rsquo;s not much; we find<br/>
Few females without some such gentle leaven,<br/>
For fear we should suppose us quite in heaven.<br/>
<br/>
I have not heard she was at all poetic,<br/>
    Though once she was seen reading the &lsquo;Bath Guide,&rsquo;<br/>
And &lsquo;Hayley&rsquo;s Triumphs,&rsquo; which she deem&rsquo;d pathetic,<br/>
    Because she said her temper had been tried<br/>
So much, the bard had really been prophetic<br/>
    Of what she had gone through with&mdash;since a bride.<br/>
But of all verse, what most ensured her praise<br/>
Were sonnets to herself, or &lsquo;bouts rimes.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Twere difficult to say what was the object<br/>
    Of Adeline, in bringing this same lay<br/>
To bear on what appear&rsquo;d to her the subject<br/>
    Of Juan&rsquo;s nervous feelings on that day.<br/>
Perhaps she merely had the simple project<br/>
    To laugh him out of his supposed dismay;<br/>
Perhaps she might wish to confirm him in it,<br/>
Though why I cannot say&mdash;at least this minute.<br/>
<br/>
But so far the immediate effect<br/>
    Was to restore him to his self-propriety,<br/>
A thing quite necessary to the elect,<br/>
    Who wish to take the tone of their society:<br/>
In which you cannot be too circumspect,<br/>
    Whether the mode be persiflage or piety,<br/>
But wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy,<br/>
On pain of much displeasing the gynocracy.<br/>
<br/>
And therefore Juan now began to rally<br/>
    His spirits, and without more explanation<br/>
To jest upon such themes in many a sally.<br/>
    Her Grace, too, also seized the same occasion,<br/>
With various similar remarks to tally,<br/>
    But wish&rsquo;d for a still more detail&rsquo;d narration<br/>
Of this same mystic friar&rsquo;s curious doings,<br/>
About the present family&rsquo;s deaths and wooings.<br/>
<br/>
Of these few could say more than has been said;<br/>
    They pass&rsquo;d as such things do, for superstition<br/>
With some, while others, who had more in dread<br/>
    The theme, half credited the strange tradition;<br/>
And much was talk&rsquo;d on all sides on that head:<br/>
    But Juan, when cross-question&rsquo;d on the vision,<br/>
Which some supposed (though he had not avow&rsquo;d it)<br/>
Had stirr&rsquo;d him, answer&rsquo;d in a way to cloud it.<br/>
<br/>
And then, the mid-day having worn to one,<br/>
    The company prepared to separate;<br/>
Some to their several pastimes, or to none,<br/>
    Some wondering &rsquo;twas so early, some so late.<br/>
There was a goodly match too, to be run<br/>
    Between some greyhounds on my lord&rsquo;s estate,<br/>
And a young race-horse of old pedigree<br/>
Match&rsquo;d for the spring, whom several went to see.<br/>
<br/>
There was a picture-dealer who had brought<br/>
    A special Titian, warranted original,<br/>
So precious that it was not to be bought,<br/>
    Though princes the possessor were besieging all.<br/>
The king himself had cheapen&rsquo;d it, but thought<br/>
    The civil list he deigns to accept (obliging all<br/>
His subjects by his gracious acceptation)<br/>
Too scanty, in these times of low taxation.<br/>
<br/>
But as Lord Henry was a connoisseur,&mdash;<br/>
    The friend of artists, if not arts,&mdash;the owner,<br/>
With motives the most classical and pure,<br/>
    So that he would have been the very donor,<br/>
Rather than seller, had his wants been fewer,<br/>
    So much he deem&rsquo;d his patronage an honour,<br/>
Had brought the capo d&rsquo;opera, not for sale,<br/>
But for his judgment&mdash;never known to fail.<br/>
<br/>
There was a modern Goth, I mean a Gothic<br/>
    Bricklayer of Babel, call&rsquo;d an architect,<br/>
Brought to survey these grey walls, which though so thick,<br/>
    Might have from time acquired some slight defect;<br/>
Who after rummaging the Abbey through thick<br/>
    And thin, produced a plan whereby to erect<br/>
New buildings of correctest conformation,<br/>
And throw down old&mdash;which he call&rsquo;d restoration.<br/>
<br/>
The cost would be a trifle&mdash;an &lsquo;old song,&rsquo;<br/>
    Set to some thousands (&rsquo;tis the usual burden<br/>
Of that same tune, when people hum it long)&mdash;<br/>
    The price would speedily repay its worth in<br/>
An edifice no less sublime than strong,<br/>
    By which Lord Henry&rsquo;s good taste would go forth in<br/>
Its glory, through all ages shining sunny,<br/>
For Gothic daring shown in English money.<br/>
<br/>
There were two lawyers busy on a mortgage<br/>
    Lord Henry wish&rsquo;d to raise for a new purchase;<br/>
Also a lawsuit upon tenures burgage,<br/>
    And one on tithes, which sure are Discord&rsquo;s torches,<br/>
Kindling Religion till she throws down her gage,<br/>
    &lsquo;Untying&rsquo; squires &lsquo;to fight against the churches;&rsquo;<br/>
There was a prize ox, a prize pig, and ploughman,<br/>
For Henry was a sort of Sabine showman.<br/>
<br/>
There were two poachers caught in a steel trap,<br/>
    Ready for gaol, their place of convalescence;<br/>
There was a country girl in a close cap<br/>
    And scarlet cloak (I hate the sight to see, since&mdash;<br/>
Since&mdash;since&mdash;in youth, I had the sad mishap&mdash;<br/>
    But luckily I have paid few parish fees since):<br/>
That scarlet cloak, alas! unclosed with rigour,<br/>
Presents the problem of a double figure.<br/>
<br/>
A reel within a bottle is a mystery,<br/>
    One can&rsquo;t tell how it e&rsquo;er got in or out;<br/>
Therefore the present piece of natural history<br/>
    I leave to those who are fond of solving doubt;<br/>
And merely state, though not for the consistory,<br/>
    Lord Henry was a justice, and that Scout<br/>
The constable, beneath a warrant&rsquo;s banner,<br/>
Had bagg&rsquo;d this poacher upon Nature&rsquo;s manor.<br/>
<br/>
Now justices of peace must judge all pieces<br/>
    Of mischief of all kinds, and keep the game<br/>
And morals of the country from caprices<br/>
    Of those who have not a license for the same;<br/>
And of all things, excepting tithes and leases,<br/>
    Perhaps these are most difficult to tame:<br/>
Preserving partridges and pretty wenches<br/>
Are puzzles to the most precautious benches.<br/>
<br/>
The present culprit was extremely pale,<br/>
    Pale as if painted so; her cheek being red<br/>
By nature, as in higher dames less hale<br/>
    &rsquo;Tis white, at least when they just rise from bed.<br/>
Perhaps she was ashamed of seeming frail,<br/>
    Poor soul! for she was country born and bred,<br/>
And knew no better in her immorality<br/>
Than to wax white&mdash;for blushes are for quality.<br/>
<br/>
Her black, bright, downcast, yet espiegle eye,<br/>
    Had gather&rsquo;d a large tear into its corner,<br/>
Which the poor thing at times essay&rsquo;d to dry,<br/>
    For she was not a sentimental mourner<br/>
Parading all her sensibility,<br/>
    Nor insolent enough to scorn the scorner,<br/>
But stood in trembling, patient tribulation,<br/>
To be call&rsquo;d up for her examination.<br/>
<br/>
Of course these groups were scatter&rsquo;d here and there,<br/>
    Not nigh the gay saloon of ladies gent.<br/>
The lawyers in the study; and in air<br/>
    The prize pig, ploughman, poachers; the men sent<br/>
From town, viz., architect and dealer, were<br/>
    Both busy (as a general in his tent<br/>
Writing despatches) in their several stations,<br/>
Exulting in their brilliant lucubrations.<br/>
<br/>
But this poor girl was left in the great hall,<br/>
    While Scout, the parish guardian of the frail,<br/>
Discuss&rsquo;d (he hated beer yclept the &lsquo;small&rsquo;)<br/>
    A mighty mug of moral double ale.<br/>
She waited until justice could recall<br/>
    Its kind attentions to their proper pale,<br/>
To name a thing in nomenclature rather<br/>
Perplexing for most virgins&mdash;a child&rsquo;s father.<br/>
<br/>
You see here was enough of occupation<br/>
    For the Lord Henry, link&rsquo;d with dogs and horses.<br/>
There was much bustle too, and preparation<br/>
    Below stairs on the score of second courses;<br/>
Because, as suits their rank and situation,<br/>
    Those who in counties have great land resources<br/>
Have &lsquo;Public days,&rsquo; when all men may carouse,<br/>
Though not exactly what &rsquo;s call&rsquo;d &lsquo;open house.&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
But once a week or fortnight, uninvited<br/>
    (Thus we translate a general invitation),<br/>
All country gentlemen, esquired or knighted,<br/>
    May drop in without cards, and take their station<br/>
At the full board, and sit alike delighted<br/>
    With fashionable wines and conversation;<br/>
And, as the isthmus of the grand connection,<br/>
Talk o&rsquo;er themselves the past and next election.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Henry was a great electioneerer,<br/>
    Burrowing for boroughs like a rat or rabbit;<br/>
But county contests cost him rather dearer,<br/>
    Because the neighbouring Scotch Earl of Giftgabbit<br/>
Had English influence in the self-same sphere here;<br/>
    His son, the Honourable Dick Dicedrabbit,<br/>
Was member for the &lsquo;other interest&rsquo; (meaning<br/>
The same self-interest, with a different leaning).<br/>
<br/>
Courteous and cautious therefore in his county,<br/>
    He was all things to all men, and dispensed<br/>
To some civility, to others bounty,<br/>
    And promises to all&mdash;which last commenced<br/>
To gather to a somewhat large amount, he<br/>
    Not calculating how much they condensed;<br/>
But what with keeping some, and breaking others,<br/>
His word had the same value as another&rsquo;s.<br/>
<br/>
A friend to freedom and freeholders&mdash;yet<br/>
    No less a friend to government&mdash;he held,<br/>
That he exactly the just medium hit<br/>
    &rsquo;Twixt place and patriotism&mdash;albeit compell&rsquo;d,<br/>
Such was his sovereign&rsquo;s pleasure (though unfit,<br/>
    He added modestly, when rebels rail&rsquo;d),<br/>
To hold some sinecures he wish&rsquo;d abolish&rsquo;d,<br/>
But that with them all law would be demolish&rsquo;d.<br/>
<br/>
He was &lsquo;free to confess&rsquo; (whence comes this phrase?<br/>
    Is &rsquo;t English? No&mdash;&rsquo;tis only parliamentary)<br/>
That innovation&rsquo;s spirit now-a-days<br/>
    Had made more progress than for the last century.<br/>
He would not tread a factious path to praise,<br/>
    Though for the public weal disposed to venture high;<br/>
As for his place, he could but say this of it,<br/>
That the fatigue was greater than the profit.<br/>
<br/>
Heaven, and his friends, knew that a private life<br/>
    Had ever been his sole and whole ambition;<br/>
But could he quit his king in times of strife,<br/>
    Which threaten&rsquo;d the whole country with perdition?<br/>
When demagogues would with a butcher&rsquo;s knife<br/>
    Cut through and through (oh! damnable incision!)<br/>
The Gordian or the Geordi-an knot, whose strings<br/>
Have tied together commons, lords, and kings.<br/>
<br/>
Sooner &lsquo;come lace into the civil list<br/>
    And champion him to the utmost&rsquo;&mdash;he would keep it,<br/>
Till duly disappointed or dismiss&rsquo;d:<br/>
    Profit he care not for, let others reap it;<br/>
But should the day come when place ceased to exist,<br/>
    The country would have far more cause to weep it:<br/>
For how could it go on? Explain who can!<br/>
He gloried in the name of Englishman.<br/>
<br/>
He was as independent&mdash;ay, much more&mdash;<br/>
    Than those who were not paid for independence,<br/>
As common soldiers, or a common&mdash;shore,<br/>
    Have in their several arts or parts ascendance<br/>
O&rsquo;er the irregulars in lust or gore,<br/>
    Who do not give professional attendance.<br/>
Thus on the mob all statesmen are as eager<br/>
To prove their pride, as footmen to a beggar.<br/>
<br/>
All this (save the last stanza) Henry said,<br/>
    And thought. I say no more&mdash;I&rsquo;ve said too much;<br/>
For all of us have either heard or read&mdash;<br/>
    Off&mdash;or upon the hustings&mdash;some slight such<br/>
Hints from the independent heart or head<br/>
    Of the official candidate. I&rsquo;ll touch<br/>
No more on this&mdash;the dinner-bell hath rung,<br/>
And grace is said; the grace I should have sung&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
But I&rsquo;m too late, and therefore must make play.<br/>
    &rsquo;Twas a great banquet, such as Albion old<br/>
Was wont to boast&mdash;as if a glutton&rsquo;s tray<br/>
    Were something very glorious to behold.<br/>
But &rsquo;twas a public feast and public day,&mdash;<br/>
    Quite full, right dull, guests hot, and dishes cold,<br/>
Great plenty, much formality, small cheer,<br/>
And every body out of their own sphere.<br/>
<br/>
The squires familiarly formal, and<br/>
    My lords and ladies proudly condescending;<br/>
The very servants puzzling how to hand<br/>
    Their plates&mdash;without it might be too much bending<br/>
From their high places by the sideboard&rsquo;s stand&mdash;<br/>
    Yet, like their masters, fearful of offending.<br/>
For any deviation from the graces<br/>
Might cost both man and master too&mdash;their places.<br/>
<br/>
There were some hunters bold, and coursers keen,<br/>
    Whose hounds ne&rsquo;er err&rsquo;d, nor greyhounds deign&rsquo;d to lurch;<br/>
Some deadly shots too, Septembrizers, seen<br/>
    Earliest to rise, and last to quit the search<br/>
Of the poor partridge through his stubble screen.<br/>
    There were some massy members of the church,<br/>
Takers of tithes, and makers of good matches,<br/>
And several who sung fewer psalms than catches.<br/>
<br/>
There were some country wags too&mdash;and, alas!<br/>
    Some exiles from the town, who had been driven<br/>
To gaze, instead of pavement, upon grass,<br/>
    And rise at nine in lieu of long eleven.<br/>
And lo! upon that day it came to pass,<br/>
    I sate next that o&rsquo;erwhelming son of heaven,<br/>
The very powerful parson, Peter Pith,<br/>
The loudest wit I e&rsquo;er was deafen&rsquo;d with.<br/>
<br/>
I knew him in his livelier London days,<br/>
    A brilliant diner out, though but a curate;<br/>
And not a joke he cut but earn&rsquo;d its praise,<br/>
    Until preferment, coming at a sure rate<br/>
(O Providence! how wondrous are thy ways!<br/>
    Who would suppose thy gifts sometimes obdurate?),<br/>
Gave him, to lay the devil who looks o&rsquo;er Lincoln,<br/>
A fat fen vicarage, and nought to think on.<br/>
<br/>
His jokes were sermons, and his sermons jokes;<br/>
    But both were thrown away amongst the fens;<br/>
For wit hath no great friend in aguish folks.<br/>
    No longer ready ears and short-hand pens<br/>
Imbibed the gay bon-mot, or happy hoax:<br/>
    The poor priest was reduced to common sense,<br/>
Or to coarse efforts very loud and long,<br/>
To hammer a horse laugh from the thick throng.<br/>
<br/>
There is a difference, says the song, &lsquo;between<br/>
    A beggar and a queen,&rsquo; or was (of late<br/>
The latter worse used of the two we&rsquo;ve seen&mdash;<br/>
    But we&rsquo;ll say nothing of affairs of state);<br/>
A difference &lsquo;&rsquo;twixt a bishop and a dean,&rsquo;<br/>
    A difference between crockery ware and plate,<br/>
As between English beef and Spartan broth&mdash;<br/>
And yet great heroes have been bred by both.<br/>
<br/>
But of all nature&rsquo;s discrepancies, none<br/>
    Upon the whole is greater than the difference<br/>
Beheld between the country and the town,<br/>
    Of which the latter merits every preference<br/>
From those who have few resources of their own,<br/>
    And only think, or act, or feel, with reference<br/>
To some small plan of interest or ambition&mdash;<br/>
Both which are limited to no condition.<br/>
<br/>
But &lsquo;en avant!&rsquo; The light loves languish o&rsquo;er<br/>
    Long banquets and too many guests, although<br/>
A slight repast makes people love much more,<br/>
    Bacchus and Ceres being, as we know<br/>
Even from our grammar upwards, friends of yore<br/>
    With vivifying Venus, who doth owe<br/>
To these the invention of champagne and truffles:<br/>
Temperance delights her, but long fasting ruffles.<br/>
<br/>
Dully past o&rsquo;er the dinner of the day;<br/>
    And Juan took his place, he knew not where,<br/>
Confused, in the confusion, and distrait,<br/>
    And sitting as if nail&rsquo;d upon his chair:<br/>
Though knives and forks clank&rsquo;d round as in a fray,<br/>
    He seem&rsquo;d unconscious of all passing there,<br/>
Till some one, with a groan, exprest a wish<br/>
(Unheeded twice) to have a fin of fish.<br/>
<br/>
On which, at the third asking of the bans,<br/>
    He started; and perceiving smiles around<br/>
Broadening to grins, he colour&rsquo;d more than once,<br/>
    And hastily&mdash;as nothing can confound<br/>
A wise man more than laughter from a dunce&mdash;<br/>
    Inflicted on the dish a deadly wound,<br/>
And with such hurry, that ere he could curb it<br/>
He had paid his neighbour&rsquo;s prayer with half a turbot.<br/>
<br/>
This was no bad mistake, as it occurr&rsquo;d,<br/>
    The supplicator being an amateur;<br/>
But others, who were left with scarce a third,<br/>
    Were angry&mdash;as they well might, to be sure.<br/>
They wonder&rsquo;d how a young man so absurd<br/>
    Lord Henry at his table should endure;<br/>
And this, and his not knowing how much oats<br/>
Had fallen last market, cost his host three votes.<br/>
<br/>
They little knew, or might have sympathised,<br/>
    That he the night before had seen a ghost,<br/>
A prologue which but slightly harmonised<br/>
    With the substantial company engross&rsquo;d<br/>
By matter, and so much materialised,<br/>
    That one scarce knew at what to marvel most<br/>
Of two things&mdash;how (the question rather odd is)<br/>
Such bodies could have souls, or souls such bodies.<br/>
<br/>
But what confused him more than smile or stare<br/>
    From all the &rsquo;squires and &rsquo;squiresses around,<br/>
Who wonder&rsquo;d at the abstraction of his air,<br/>
    Especially as he had been renown&rsquo;d<br/>
For some vivacity among the fair,<br/>
    Even in the country circle&rsquo;s narrow bound<br/>
(For little things upon my lord&rsquo;s estate<br/>
Were good small talk for others still less great)&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
Was, that he caught Aurora&rsquo;s eye on his,<br/>
    And something like a smile upon her cheek.<br/>
Now this he really rather took amiss:<br/>
    In those who rarely smile, their smiles bespeak<br/>
A strong external motive; and in this<br/>
    Smile of Aurora&rsquo;s there was nought to pique<br/>
Or hope, or love, with any of the wiles<br/>
Which some pretend to trace in ladies&rsquo; smiles.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Twas a mere quiet smile of contemplation,<br/>
    Indicative of some surprise and pity;<br/>
And Juan grew carnation with vexation,<br/>
    Which was not very wise, and still less witty,<br/>
Since he had gain&rsquo;d at least her observation,<br/>
    A most important outwork of the city&mdash;<br/>
As Juan should have known, had not his senses<br/>
By last night&rsquo;s ghost been driven from their defences.<br/>
<br/>
But what was bad, she did not blush in turn,<br/>
    Nor seem embarrass&rsquo;d&mdash;quite the contrary;<br/>
Her aspect was as usual, still&mdash;not stern&mdash;<br/>
    And she withdrew, but cast not down, her eye,<br/>
Yet grew a little pale&mdash;with what? concern?<br/>
    I know not; but her colour ne&rsquo;er was high&mdash;<br/>
Though sometimes faintly flush&rsquo;d&mdash;and always clear,<br/>
As deep seas in a sunny atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
But Adeline was occupied by fame<br/>
    This day; and watching, witching, condescending<br/>
To the consumers of fish, fowl, and game,<br/>
    And dignity with courtesy so blending,<br/>
As all must blend whose part it is to aim<br/>
    (Especially as the sixth year is ending)<br/>
At their lord&rsquo;s, son&rsquo;s, or similar connection&rsquo;s<br/>
Safe conduct through the rocks of re-elections.<br/>
<br/>
Though this was most expedient on the whole,<br/>
    And usual&mdash;Juan, when he cast a glance<br/>
On Adeline while playing her grand role,<br/>
    Which she went through as though it were a dance,<br/>
Betraying only now and then her soul<br/>
    By a look scarce perceptibly askance<br/>
(Of weariness or scorn), began to feel<br/>
Some doubt how much of Adeline was real;<br/>
<br/>
So well she acted all and every part<br/>
    By turns&mdash;with that vivacious versatility,<br/>
Which many people take for want of heart.<br/>
    They err&mdash;&rsquo;tis merely what is call&rsquo;d mobility,<br/>
A thing of temperament and not of art,<br/>
    Though seeming so, from its supposed facility;<br/>
And false&mdash;though true; for surely they&rsquo;re sincerest<br/>
Who are strongly acted on by what is nearest.<br/>
<br/>
This makes your actors, artists, and romancers,<br/>
    Heroes sometimes, though seldom&mdash;sages never;<br/>
But speakers, bards, diplomatists, and dancers,<br/>
    Little that &rsquo;s great, but much of what is clever;<br/>
Most orators, but very few financiers,<br/>
    Though all Exchequer chancellors endeavour,<br/>
Of late years, to dispense with Cocker&rsquo;s rigours,<br/>
And grow quite figurative with their figures.<br/>
<br/>
The poets of arithmetic are they<br/>
    Who, though they prove not two and two to be<br/>
Five, as they might do in a modest way,<br/>
    Have plainly made it out that four are three,<br/>
Judging by what they take, and what they pay.<br/>
    The Sinking Fund&rsquo;s unfathomable sea,<br/>
That most unliquidating liquid, leaves<br/>
The debt unsunk, yet sinks all it receives.<br/>
<br/>
While Adeline dispensed her airs and graces,<br/>
    The fair Fitz-Fulke seem&rsquo;d very much at ease;<br/>
Though too well bred to quiz men to their faces,<br/>
    Her laughing blue eyes with a glance could seize<br/>
The ridicules of people in all places&mdash;<br/>
    That honey of your fashionable bees&mdash;<br/>
And store it up for mischievous enjoyment;<br/>
And this at present was her kind employment.<br/>
<br/>
However, the day closed, as days must close;<br/>
    The evening also waned&mdash;and coffee came.<br/>
Each carriage was announced, and ladies rose,<br/>
    And curtsying off, as curtsies country dame,<br/>
Retired: with most unfashionable bows<br/>
    Their docile esquires also did the same,<br/>
Delighted with their dinner and their host,<br/>
But with the Lady Adeline the most.<br/>
<br/>
Some praised her beauty; others her great grace;<br/>
    The warmth of her politeness, whose sincerity<br/>
Was obvious in each feature of her face,<br/>
    Whose traits were radiant with the rays of verity.<br/>
Yes; she was truly worthy her high place!<br/>
    No one could envy her deserved prosperity.<br/>
And then her dress&mdash;what beautiful simplicity<br/>
Draperied her form with curious felicity!<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile Sweet Adeline deserved their praises,<br/>
    By an impartial indemnification<br/>
For all her past exertion and soft phrases,<br/>
    In a most edifying conversation,<br/>
Which turn&rsquo;d upon their late guests&rsquo; miens and faces,<br/>
    And families, even to the last relation;<br/>
Their hideous wives, their horrid selves and dresses,<br/>
And truculent distortion of their tresses.<br/>
<br/>
True, she said little&mdash;&rsquo;twas the rest that broke<br/>
    Forth into universal epigram;<br/>
But then &rsquo;twas to the purpose what she spoke:<br/>
    Like Addison&rsquo;s &lsquo;faint praise,&rsquo; so wont to damn,<br/>
Her own but served to set off every joke,<br/>
    As music chimes in with a melodrame.<br/>
How sweet the task to shield an absent friend!<br/>
I ask but this of mine, to&mdash;not defend.<br/>
<br/>
There were but two exceptions to this keen<br/>
    Skirmish of wits o&rsquo;er the departed; one<br/>
Aurora, with her pure and placid mien;<br/>
    And Juan, too, in general behind none<br/>
In gay remark on what he had heard or seen,<br/>
    Sate silent now, his usual spirits gone:<br/>
In vain he heard the others rail or rally,<br/>
He would not join them in a single sally.<br/>
<br/>
&rsquo;Tis true he saw Aurora look as though<br/>
    She approved his silence; she perhaps mistook<br/>
Its motive for that charity we owe<br/>
    But seldom pay the absent, nor would look<br/>
Farther&mdash;it might or might not be so.<br/>
    But Juan, sitting silent in his nook,<br/>
Observing little in his reverie,<br/>
Yet saw this much, which he was glad to see.<br/>
<br/>
The ghost at least had done him this much good,<br/>
    In making him as silent as a ghost,<br/>
If in the circumstances which ensued<br/>
    He gain&rsquo;d esteem where it was worth the most.<br/>
And certainly Aurora had renew&rsquo;d<br/>
    In him some feelings he had lately lost,<br/>
Or harden&rsquo;d; feelings which, perhaps ideal,<br/>
Are so divine, that I must deem them real:&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
The love of higher things and better days;<br/>
    The unbounded hope, and heavenly ignorance<br/>
Of what is call&rsquo;d the world, and the world&rsquo;s ways;<br/>
    The moments when we gather from a glance<br/>
More joy than from all future pride or praise,<br/>
    Which kindle manhood, but can ne&rsquo;er entrance<br/>
The heart in an existence of its own,<br/>
Of which another&rsquo;s bosom is the zone.<br/>
<br/>
Who would not sigh Ai ai Tan Kuuerheian<br/>
    That hath a memory, or that had a heart?<br/>
Alas! her star must fade like that of Dian:<br/>
    Ray fades on ray, as years on years depart.<br/>
Anacreon only had the soul to tie an<br/>
    Unwithering myrtle round the unblunted dart<br/>
Of Eros: but though thou hast play&rsquo;d us many tricks,<br/>
Still we respect thee, &lsquo;Alma Venus Genetrix!&rsquo;<br/>
<br/>
And full of sentiments, sublime as billows<br/>
    Heaving between this world and worlds beyond,<br/>
Don Juan, when the midnight hour of pillows<br/>
    Arrived, retired to his; but to despond<br/>
Rather than rest. Instead of poppies, willows<br/>
    Waved o&rsquo;er his couch; he meditated, fond<br/>
Of those sweet bitter thoughts which banish sleep,<br/>
And make the worldling sneer, the youngling weep.<br/>
<br/>
The night was as before: he was undrest,<br/>
    Saving his night-gown, which is an undress;<br/>
Completely &lsquo;sans culotte,&rsquo; and without vest;<br/>
    In short, he hardly could be clothed with less:<br/>
But apprehensive of his spectral guest,<br/>
    He sate with feelings awkward to express<br/>
(By those who have not had such visitations),<br/>
Expectant of the ghost&rsquo;s fresh operations.<br/>
<br/>
And not in vain he listen&rsquo;d;&mdash;Hush! what &rsquo;s that?<br/>
    I see&mdash;I see&mdash;Ah, no!&mdash;&rsquo;tis not&mdash;yet &rsquo;tis&mdash;<br/>
Ye powers! it is the&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;Pooh! the cat!<br/>
    The devil may take that stealthy pace of his!<br/>
So like a spiritual pit-a-pat,<br/>
    Or tiptoe of an amatory Miss,<br/>
Gliding the first time to a rendezvous,<br/>
And dreading the chaste echoes of her shoe.<br/>
<br/>
Again&mdash;what is &rsquo;t? The wind? No, no&mdash;this time<br/>
    It is the sable friar as before,<br/>
With awful footsteps regular as rhyme,<br/>
    Or (as rhymes may be in these days) much more.<br/>
Again through shadows of the night sublime,<br/>
    When deep sleep fell on men, and the world wore<br/>
The starry darkness round her like a girdle<br/>
Spangled with gems&mdash;the monk made his blood curdle.<br/>
<br/>
A noise like to wet fingers drawn on glass,<br/>
    Which sets the teeth on edge; and a slight clatter,<br/>
Like showers which on the midnight gusts will pass,<br/>
    Sounding like very supernatural water,<br/>
Came over Juan&rsquo;s ear, which throbb&rsquo;d, alas!<br/>
    For immaterialism &rsquo;s a serious matter;<br/>
So that even those whose faith is the most great<br/>
In souls immortal, shun them tete-a-tete.<br/>
<br/>
Were his eyes open?&mdash;Yes! and his mouth too.<br/>
    Surprise has this effect&mdash;to make one dumb,<br/>
Yet leave the gate which eloquence slips through<br/>
    As wide as if a long speech were to come.<br/>
Nigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew,<br/>
    Tremendous to a mortal tympanum:<br/>
His eyes were open, and (as was before<br/>
Stated) his mouth. What open&rsquo;d next?&mdash;the door.<br/>
<br/>
It open&rsquo;d with a most infernal creak,<br/>
    Like that of hell. &lsquo;Lasciate ogni speranza<br/>
Voi che entrate!&rsquo; The hinge seem&rsquo;d to speak,<br/>
    Dreadful as Dante&rsquo;s rhima, or this stanza;<br/>
Or&mdash;but all words upon such themes are weak:<br/>
    A single shade &rsquo;s sufficient to entrance<br/>
Hero&mdash;for what is substance to a spirit?<br/>
Or how is &rsquo;t matter trembles to come near it?<br/>
<br/>
The door flew wide,&mdash;not swiftly, but, as fly<br/>
    The sea-gulls, with a steady, sober flight,<br/>
And then swung back, nor close, but stood awry,<br/>
    Half letting in long shadows on the light,<br/>
Which still in Juan&rsquo;s candlesticks burned high,<br/>
    For he had two, both tolerably bright,<br/>
And in the doorway, darkening darkness, stood<br/>
The sable Friar in his solemn hood.<br/>
<br/>
Between two worlds life hovers like a star,<br/>
    &rsquo;Twixt night and morn, upon the horizon&rsquo;s verge.<br/>
How little do we know that which we are!<br/>
    How less what we may be! The eternal surge<br/>
Of time and tide rolls on, and bears afar<br/>
    Our bubbles; as the old burst, new emerge,<br/>
Lash&rsquo;d from the foam of ages; while the graves<br/>
Of empires heave but like some passing waves.<br/>
<br/>
Don Juan shook, as erst he had been shaken<br/>
    The night before, but being sick of shaking,<br/>
He first inclined to think he had been mistaken,<br/>
    And then to be ashamed of such mistaking.<br/>
His own internal ghost began to awaken<br/>
    Within him and to quell his corporal quaking,<br/>
Hinting that soul and body on the whole<br/>
Were odds against a disembodied soul.<br/>
<br/>
And then his dread grew wrath, and his wrath fierce,<br/>
    And he arose, advanced. The shade retreated,<br/>
But Juan, eager now the truth to pierce,<br/>
    Followed, his veins no longer cold, but heated,<br/>
Resolved to thrust the mystery carte and tierce,<br/>
    At whatsoever risk of being defeated.<br/>
The ghost stopped, menaced, then retired, until<br/>
He reached the ancient wall, then stood stone still.<br/>
<br/>
Juan put forth one arm. Eternal powers!<br/>
    It touched no soul nor body, but the wall,<br/>
On which the moonbeams fell in silvery showers<br/>
    Checkered with all the tracery of the hall.<br/>
He shuddered, as no doubt the bravest cowers<br/>
    When he can&rsquo;t tell what &rsquo;tis that doth appal.<br/>
How odd, a single hobgoblin&rsquo;s nonentity<br/>
Should cause more fear than a whole host&rsquo;s identity.<br/>
<br/>
But still the shade remained, the blue eyes glared,<br/>
    And rather variably for stony death.<br/>
Yet one thing rather good the grave had spared;<br/>
    The ghost had a remarkably sweet breath.<br/>
A straggling curl showed he had been fair-haired.<br/>
    A red lip with two rows of pearls beneath<br/>
Gleamed forth, as through the casement&rsquo;s ivy shroud<br/>
The moon peeped, just escaped from a grey cloud.<br/>
<br/>
And Juan, puzzled but still curious, thrust<br/>
    His other arm forth. Wonder upon wonder!<br/>
It pressed upon a hard but glowing bust,<br/>
Which beat as if there was a warm heart under.<br/>
He found, as people on most trials must,<br/>
    That he had made at first a silly blunder<br/>
And that in his confusion he had caught<br/>
Only the wall, instead of what he sought<br/>
<br/>
The ghost, if ghost it were, seemed a sweet soul<br/>
    As ever lurked beneath a holy hood.<br/>
A dimpled chin, a neck of ivory stole<br/>
    Forth into something much like flesh and blood.<br/>
Back fell the sable frock and dreary cowl<br/>
    And they revealed, alas, that ere they should,<br/>
In full, voluptuous, but not o&rsquo;ergrown bulk,<br/>
The phantom of her frolic Grace&mdash;Fitz-Fulke!<br/>

<h2><a name="2H_4_0018"></a>
CANTO THE SEVENTEENTH.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
The world is full of orphans: firstly, those<br/>
     Who are so in the strict sense of the phrase<br/>
(But many a lonely tree the loftier grows<br/>
     Than others crowded in the forest&rsquo;s maze);<br/>
The next are such as are not doomed to lose<br/>
     Their tender parents in their budding days,<br/>
But merely their parental tenderness,<br/>
Which leaves them orphans of the heart no less.<br/>
<br/>
The next are &lsquo;only children&rsquo;, as they are styled,<br/>
     Who grow up children only, since the old saw<br/>
Pronounces that an &lsquo;only&rsquo; &rsquo;s a spoilt child.<br/>
     But not to go too far, I hold it law<br/>
That where their education, harsh or mild,<br/>
     &lsquo;Transgresses the great bounds of love or awe,<br/>
The sufferers, be&rsquo;t in heart or intellect,<br/>
Whate&rsquo;er the cause are orphans in effect.<br/>
<br/>
But to return unto the stricter rule<br/>
    (As far as words make rules), our common notion<br/>
Of orphans paints at once a parish school,<br/>
     A half-starved babe, a wreck upon life&rsquo;s ocean,<br/>
A human (what the Italians nickname) &lsquo;mule&rsquo;,<br/>
     A theme for pity or some worse emotion;<br/>
Yet, if examined, it might be admitted<br/>
The wealthiest orphans are to be more pitied.<br/>
<br/>
Too soon they are parents to themselves; for what<br/>
     Are tutors, guardians, and so forth, compared<br/>
With Nature&rsquo;s genial genitors, so that<br/>
    A child of Chancery, that Star Chamber ward<br/>
(I&rsquo;ll take the likeness I can first come at),<br/>
     Is like a duckling by Dame Partlett reared<br/>
And frights, especially if &rsquo;tis a daughter,<br/>
The old hen by running headlong to the water.<br/>
<br/>
There is a commonplace book argument,<br/>
    Which glibly glides from every vulgar tongue<br/>
When any dare a new light to present:<br/>
    &lsquo;If you are right, then everybody&rsquo;s wrong.&rsquo;<br/>
Suppose the converse of this precedent<br/>
    So often urged, so loudly and so long:<br/>
&lsquo;If you are wrong, then everybody&rsquo;s right.&rsquo;<br/>
Was ever everybody yet so quite?<br/>
<br/>
Therefore I would solicit free discussion<br/>
    Upon all points, no matter what or whose,<br/>
Because as ages upon ages push on,<br/>
    The last is apt the former to accuse<br/>
Of pillowing its head on a pincushion,<br/>
    Heedless of pricks because it was obtuse.<br/>
What was a paradox becomes a truth or<br/>
A something like it, as bear witness Luther.<br/>
<br/>
The sacraments have been reduced to two<br/>
    And witches unto none, though somewhat late<br/>
Since burning aged women (save a few,<br/>
    Not witches, only bitches, who create<br/>
Mischief in families, as some know or knew,<br/>
    Should still be singed, but slightly let me state)<br/>
Has been declared an act of inurbanity,<br/>
Malgé  Sir Matthew Hale&rsquo;s great humanity.<br/>
<br/>
Great Galileo was debarred the sun,<br/>
    Because he fixed it, and to stop his talking<br/>
How earth could round the solar orbit run,<br/>
    Found his own legs embargoed from mere walking.<br/>
The man was well nigh dead, ere men begun<br/>
    To think his skull had not some need of caulking,<br/>
But now it seems he&rsquo;s right, his notion just,<br/>
No doubt a consolation to his dust.<br/>
<br/>
Pythagoras, Locke, Socrates&mdash;but pages<br/>
     Might be filled up, as vainly as before,<br/>
With the sad usage of all sorts of sages,<br/>
     Who in his lifetime each was deemed a bore.<br/>
The loftiest minds outrun their tardy ages;<br/>
    This they must bear with and perhaps much more.<br/>
The wise man&rsquo;s sure when he no more can share it, he<br/>
Will have a firm post-obit on posterity.<br/>
<br/>
If such doom waits each intellectual giant,<br/>
We little people in our lesser way<br/>
To life&rsquo;s small rubs should surely be more pliant,<br/>
    And so for one will I, as well I may.<br/>
Would that I were less bilious&mdash;but oh fie on&rsquo;t!<br/>
    Just as I make my mind up everyday<br/>
To be a totus teres stoic, sage,<br/>
The wind shifts and I fly into a rage.<br/>
<br/>
Temperate I am, yet never had a temper;<br/>
    Modest I am, yet with some slight assurance;<br/>
Changeable too, yet somehow idem semper;<br/>
Patient, but not enamoured of endurance;<br/>
Cheerful, but sometimes rather apt to whimper;<br/>
    Mild, but at times a sort of Hercules furens;<br/>
So that I almost think that the same skin<br/>
For one without has two or three within.<br/>
<br/>
Our hero was in canto the sixteenth<br/>
    Left in a tender moonlight situation,<br/>
Such as enables man to show his strength<br/>
    Moral or physical On this occasion<br/>
Whether his virtue triumphed, or at length<br/>
    His vice&mdash;for he was of a kindling nation&mdash;<br/>
Is more than I shall venture to describe,<br/>
Unless some beauty with a kiss should bribe.<br/>
<br/>
I leave the thing a problem, like all things.<br/>
    The morning came, and breakfast, tea and toast,<br/>
Of which most men partake, but no one sings.<br/>
    The company, whose birth, wealth, worth have cost<br/>
My trembling lyre already several strings,<br/>
    Assembled with our hostess and mine host.<br/>
The guests dropped in, the last but one, Her Grace,<br/>
The latest, Juan with his virgin face.<br/>
<br/>
Which best is to encounter, ghost or none,<br/>
    &rsquo;Twere difficult to say, but Juan looked<br/>
As if he had combated with more than one,<br/>
    Being wan and worn, with eyes that hardly brooked<br/>
The light that through the Gothic windows shone.<br/>
    Her Grace too had a sort of air rebuked,<br/>
Seemed pale and shivered, as if she had kept<br/>
A vigil or dreamt rather more than slept.<br/>
